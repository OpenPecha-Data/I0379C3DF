Homage to all the Buddhas and bodhisatvas (namaḥ sarvabuddhabodhisatvebhyaḥ)
I. The Occasion
Thus I heard: Once the Lord stayed at the place of the Tathāgatas, the courtyard adorned with jewels, the dwelling place of all the Tathāgatas (evaṃ mayā śrutam ekasmin samaye bhagavān tathāgatagocare ratnavyūhamaṇḍalamāḍe sarvatathāgataniveśane);the accumulation of the ornaments of great merit (mahāpuṇyālaṃkārasaṃbhāropacaye);the outcome of great conduct (mahācaryāniṣyande);completely accomplished all qualities of buddhas through the karmic fruition (sarvabuddhadharmavipākābhinirvṛtte);the place of the bodhisatva, the great beings (mahābodhisatvabhavane); [the place] of infinite teachings (anatanidarśane);blessed with the manifestation of tathāgatas (tathāgatavikurvāṇādhiṣṭhāne);the way into the place through unattached wisdom (asaṅgagocarajñānapraveśe);the source of great happiness (mahāmuditā samudaye);the way into the recollection, intelligence, and understanding [of religion] (smṛtimatigatipraveśe);never to be derided [by anyone] (’nānindite);consideration through knowledge (jñānavyavacāre);the way into the lack of self-nature (tadasvabhāvapraveśe);praised through the future world-ages (’parāntakalpābhiṣṭute);remained in immeasurable multitude of all good qualities (sarvaguṇāprameyasaṃcaye).
The Lord had fully woken up to the fact that all moments of existence are of the same character (bhagavān sarvadharmasamatābhisaṃbuddhaḥ);had set the wheel of religion in motion (supravartitadharmacakro);training completely endless of disciples (’nantaśiṣyagaṇasuvinītaḥ);having obtained power of all dharmas (sarvadharmavaśitāprāptaḥ);knowing well all kinds of intentions in living beings (sarvasatvāśayakāryajña);having perfected exquisite abilities of perception (indriyaparamapāramitāprāptaḥ);skilled in subduing the habit of vice which are connections in all sentient being (sarvasatvakleśavāsanānusaṃdhisamudghātanakuśalo);never ceasing to perform his effortless Buddha-activities (’nābhogabuddhakāryāpratiprasrabdho).With him was a great congregation of six million monks (mahatā bhikṣusaṃghena sārdhaṃ ṣaṣṭyā bhikṣuniyutaiḥ);all of them with disciplined mind (sarvair ājāneyacittaiḥ);thoroughly liberated their mind through right knowledge (samyagājñāsuvimukticittaiḥ);making effort to completely destroy the connection of all habits of vices (sarvakleśavāsanānusaṃdhisamudghātanābhiyuktais);the son of tathagata, the king of dharma (tathāgatadharmarājaputrair); skilled in staying according to the profound teaching (dharmagambhīravihārakuśalair);perfected in the moments of existence beyond objectification (anālambanadharmanirjātaiḥ);perfected by their admirable behavior (prāsādikeryāpathasaṃpannair);very worthy of offering (mahādakṣiṇīyais);faithful to follow the teaching of the Tathagata (tathāgatājñāsupratipannaiḥ).
The Bodhisatvas, the great beings had assembled from many different buddha-fields and they were innumerable, endless, and inexpressible. With him was also a great assembly of ineffable bodhisatvas. (nānābuddhakṣetrasaṃnipatitair bodhisatvamahāsatvāprameyāpramāṇābhilapyair mahābhilapyabodhisatvagaṇena sārdhaṃ);skilled in transmigration through infinite buddha-field in an instant (sarvacittakṣaṇikānantabuddhakṣetragatikuśalaiḥ);had always worshipped the Tathāgatas, skilled in paying homage to [them](sarvatathāgatapūjopasthānakuśalair);sought to receive teachings (atṛptadharmaparyeṣṭibhiḥ);constantly striving to throughly mature all sentient beings (satatasamitaṃ sarvasatvaparipācanānuyuktaiḥ);attained the perfection of the best skillful means and knowledge (prajñopāyaparamapāramitābhir);thoroughly established in unobstructed emancipation (anāvaraṇamokṣapratiṣṭhitaiḥ);perfectly transcended all mental constructions and conceptual consciousness (sarvakalpavikalpaprapañcasamatikrāntaiḥ);near to the stage of omniscience. They were like this. (sarvajñajñānāsannībhūtais tad yathā)The bodhisatva Vidyuddeva, the bodhisatva Yuddhajaya, the bodhisatva Vairocanagarbha, the bodhisatva Parākramavikrama, the bodhisatva Vimatismudghātin, the bodihsatva Vighuṣṭaśabda, the bodhisatva Vyavalokanacakṣur, the bodhisatva Vigatatamasā, (vidyuddena ca bodhisatvena yuddhajayena ca bodhisatvena vairocanagarbhena ca bodhisatvena parākramavikrameṇa ca bodhisatvena vimatisamudghātinā ca bodhisatva vighuṣṭaśabdena ca bodhisatvena vyavalokanacakṣuṣā ca bodhisatvena vigatatamasā ca)and so forth, with immeasurable, innumerable, incalculable, inconceivable, unequalled, incomparable bodhisatvas, the great beings (evaṃ pramukhair asaṃkhyeyāprameyāpramāṇācintyāsamāmeyair bodhisatvair mahāsatvaiḥ).[they were] infinite, ineffable, again ineffable (aprameyānabhilāpyānabhilāpyaiḥ sārdham);
II. Introduction
Then The Lord revealed the exposition of religion entitled the chapter of The Great Colleciton to bodhisatvas, the great beings (atha khalu bhagavān mahāsaṃnipātaparivartaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ bodhisatvānāṃ mahāsatvānāṃ prakāśayati sma mahāsaṃnipātaparivarte dharmaparyāye nirdiśyamāne).  Below is the reconstruction of the Dharmakṣema version as corresponding to and based on Akṣ p. 17,6ff. There seems to be some, but fairly few differences from the Tibetan Akṣ text as reconstructed into Sanskrit. atha khalu bhagavān bodhisatvacaryāpraveśaniryātyanāvaraṇamukhaṃ nāma dharmaparyāyaṃ, bodhisatvamārgavyūhaṃ, sarvagambhīrabuddhadharmadaśabalavaiśāradyapariniṣpattiṃ, sarvadharmādhipatyajñānaprāptiṃ, dhāraṇīmudrāmukhapraveśaṃ, viniścitapratisaṃvinmukhapraveśaṃ, mahābhijñāmukhapraveśam, avaivartikadharmacakrasarvayānasamatāmukhapraveśaṃ, asaṃbhinnaikanayadharmadhātumukhapraveśaṃ, sarvasatvāśayendriyāvatāraṇa nirdeśamukhapraveśaṃ, sāradharmaviniścayaṃ sarvamāramaṇḍalavidhvaṃsanaṃ yoniśo 'nugatadharmamukhapraveśaṃ, sarvānusaṃdhidṛṣṭigatasamudghātam asaṅgaprajñājñānamukhapraveśaṃ, asamatāpraṇidhānopāyajñānamukhapraveśaṃ, sarvabuddhasamatājñānamukhapraveśaṃ, sarvadharmāpratihatajñānayathābhūtaviniścayamukhapraveśaṃ, gambhīrapratītyasamutpādādhigamamukhapraveśaṃ, puṇyajñānabuddhakāyavākcittālaṃkāra sārādhimuktyakṣayasmṛtimukhapraveśaṃ, caturāryasatyamukhapraveśaṃ śrāvakayānavineyārthāya, kāyacittapravivekacaryamukhapraveśaṃ pratyekabuddhayānavineyārthāya, sarvajñajñānabhūmyabhiṣekapratilambhamukhapraveśaṃ bodhisatvayānavineyārthāya, sarvadharmādhipatyamukhapraveśaṃ buddhaguṇodbhāvanārthāya, bhāṣate deśayati prakāśayaty ārocayati samādāpayati vācayati jñāpayati vijñāpayati prajñāpayati pravartayati vivarati vibhajayaty uttānīkaroti samprakāśayati sma.The whole assembly thought "I am sitting in the pavilion in the vault of the sky (sarvāvatī parṣad aham gaganatale mahāvyūhakūṭāgārāntara āsanna iti)."The display of these marvelous pavilions illuminated the sight of living beings (teṣām eva kūṭāgārārāṇāṃ vyūhaḥ satvānāṃ darśanapathe ’vabhāsayati sma).Except for the bodhisatvas, the great beings, the great disciples, the highest gods, snake-gods, demons and celestial musicians who were seated in the pavilions, the rest of the beings in this system of threefold thousand great thousands of worlds, appearing as a form, was eclipsed. All of them thought "I am just like space." (kūṭāgāreṣu niṣaṇṇān bodhisatvān mahāsatvān mahāśrāvakāṃś ca punar api devanāgayakṣagandharvān tān sarvān sthāpayitvā trisahasramahāsahasralokadhātuṣu anavabhāsān abhūvann te 'pi gaganāsanna iti)As the empty space at the end of the aeon, the manifestations of forms in the great three-thousand of worlds disappeared from the sight of anyone (tadyathā kalpaparyavasāne gaganasamā bhavanti trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuṣu rūpāvabhāsā ye kecit anavabhāsā bhavanti tadā ye rūpāvabhāsāḥ satvebhyaḥ darśanapathe anavabhāsitāḥ).These pavilions were illuminated like the pavilions which bodhisatvas had stayed in the Mahāvyūha universe of the tathāgāta Ekaratnavyūha.Except for those who were sitting in the pavilion in the sky, the rest of them in the great three-thousand of worlds, staying on the surface of the earth, as far as its foundations, thought that they had disappeared. Also the king of the mountain, Mt. Sumeru, Mt. Cakravāḍa, and Mt. Mahācakravāḍa (parvatarājasumerucakravāḍamahācakravāḍa) disappeared from the sight of living beings.Villages, towns, market-towns, royal cities, capitals (grāmanagaranigamarāṣṭrarājadhānī) were also eclipsed. However, with the lion’s throne (simhāsana) of the Lord it was another matter, they perceived it as shining ten thousand yojanas high as placed in these pavilions placed in the vault of the sky.By the light of the lion’s throne on which the Lord was seated, the great three-thousand thousands of worlds were illumined with a grand lustre. The great three-thousand of worlds, the sun, the moon, the stars, Indra, Brahma, and the the protectors of the world (trisahasramahāsahasralokadhātor candrasūryajyotiṣa śakrabrahmalokapālānām avabhāsa), all of them were eclipsed (dhyāmīkṛta).When that whole assembly of bodhisatvas saw these miracles, wonders, and amazing phenomena (prātihāryāścaryādbhuta), they said to one another: “It would not be easy for us to see such an exceptional grandeur as the splendor of this pavilion even if our lifetime would fill an aeon (kalpasthitikāyuḥpramāṇa). Thus the virtues of these pavilions (kūṭāgārāṇāṃ guṇavyūhāḥ) are immeasurable.”
Then, by the power of the Lord, the Venerable Śāriputra rose from [his seat in] the pavilion, stood in the space, placed his knees upon the ground (jānumaṇḍala), saluted the Lord with his hands put together, and addressed himself to the Lord. (atha khalu buddhānubhāvenāyuṣmāñ śāriputra utthāya kūṭāgārād gagane sthitvā jānumaṇḍalaṃ pṛthivyāṃ pratiṣṭhāpya yena bhagavāṃs tenāñjaliṃ praṇamya bhagavantam etad avocat)"Except these pavilions found in space, O Lord, all of the great three-thousands of worlds have changed into space, becoming the essence of empty space (ākāśasvabhāva) - what does this auspicious sign (pūrvanimitta) portend?"The Lord said: "Do you see, Śāriputra, these pavilions?" Śāriputra said: "O Lord, I see them." (bhagavān āyuṣmantaṃ śāriputram āmantrayate sma paśyasi tvaṃ śāriputra imān kūṭāgārān | āha paśyāmi bhagavan)The Lord said: “Is it possible to know the limit of the praise (praśaṃsā) of these pavilions?” Śāriputra said: “I cannot understand, O Lord, the limit of the praise of these pavilions until the end of my life.”The Lord said: “Śāriputra, just as this whole assembly, having gone to open space, appear to enter into the well-adorned pavilion, in the same way they enter into the pavilion in the Mahāvyūha universe.”Śāriputra said, “O Lord, where is the splendor of Mahāvyūha universe (prabhamahāvyūhalokadhātu)?” The Lord said, “There is, Śāriputra, the universe named Mahāvyūha where it is located in the eastern direction (pūrvasyān diśi), beyond eight buddha-fields (aṣṭa buddhakṣetrāṇi) which are filled with dustlike (paramāṇurajas) numerous buddha-fields. There the tathāgata named Ekaratnavyūha resides, lives, and teaches religion (tatraikaratnavyūha nāma tathāgato tiṣṭhati dhriyate yāpayati dharmaṃ deśayati)..O Śāriputra, except for the jewel that is the thought of awakwning (bodhicitta), any other jewels do not appear in the Mahāvyūha universe.That is why he is called the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha. (tenocyate tathāgata ekaratnavyūha iti)When the Tathāgata on the lion’s throne (siṃhāsana) taught religion to those bodhisatvas, he was elevated into the vault of the sky as high as eighty tāla koṭis. So did the bodhisatvas in the Mahāvhūya pavilion.
When the bodhisatvas rose into the vault of the sky, they listened to the preaching of the tathāgata. And the tathāgata taught the dharma-seal named gaganapariśuddhi. (sa tathāgato gaganapariśuddhir iti dharmamudrāṃ saṃprakāśayati sma)O Śāriputra, it is impossible to enumerate the usufructs (paribhoga) of the bodhisatvas in the pavilion of the Mahāvyūha for their entire lifespan.O Śāriputra, do you see this lion’s throne?” He said “Yes. O Lord, I see it.” (paśyasi śāriputraṃ siṃhāsanam | āha | paśyāmi bhagavan |)The Lord said: “O Śāriputra, the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha, seating in the lion’s throne thus, explained the Dharma-seal called Gaganapariśuddhi to these bodhisatvas, which has thirty-two aspects of entrance (amīṣāṃ bodhisatvānāṃ gaganapariśuddhim dharmamudrām dvātriṃśadākārapraveśām saṃprakāśayati sma).What is this Dharma-seal called Gaganapariśuddhi which has thirty-two forms of entrance (katamā dvātriṃśadākārapreveśā gaganapariśuddhir dharmamudrā)? 1Namely, 1) all moments of existence are free from existence and non-existence because they have no proper nature (tad yathā sarvadharmā bhāvābhāvavigatā niḥsvabhāvena);2) all moments of existence are without a proper nature, because of their essential characteristic of cognition (sarvadharmā niḥsvabhāvā vijñaptilakṣaṇena);3) all moments of existence are without cognition because they are invisible (sarvadharmā avijñaptayo ’dṛśyena);4) all moments of existence are invisible because they lack causes and objects (sarvadharmā adṛśyā hetvālambanavigatena);5) all moments of existence lack objects because they are calm (sarvadharmā anālambanā upaśāntalakṣaṇena);6) all moments of existence are clam because they are without duality (sarvadharmā upaśāntā advayena) ;7) all moments of existence are without duality because of their homogeneity (sarvadharmā advayā asaṃbhedena);8) all moments of existence are without difference as they can be approached with one principle (sarvadharmā asaṃbhedā ekanayapraveśena);9) all moments of existence can be approached with one principle because they have no essential character of proper being (sarvadharmā ekanayapraveśāḥ svabhāvalakṣaṇavigatena);10) all moments of existence have no essential character of proper being because they completely transcend the three times (sarvadharmā svabhāvalakṣaṇavigatās tryadhvasamatikrāntena);11) all moments of existence are like the vault of the sky because they are not dependent on anything (sarvadharmā gaganatale sarvato ’pratiṣṭhitā aniśritena);12) all moments of existence is the entry into not being established anywhere because they are not manifested anywhere (sarvadharmā apratiṣṭhitapraveśāḥ sarvatrānābhāsena);13) all moments of existence are not manifested anywhere because they completely transcend the perceptual objects (sarvadharmā anābhāsā gocaramārgasamatikrāntena);14) all moments of existence are without objects because of their purity of inner and outer (sarvadharmā aviṣayā ādhyātmabāhyaviśuddhyā);15) all moments of existence are thoroughly pure because they are essentially beyond vices (sarvadharmā viśuddhāḥ svabhāvāsaṃkliṣṭena);16) all moments of existence are fully purified because of their essential tranquility (sarvadharmā prakṛtipariśuddhāḥ svabhāvopaśāntena);17) all moments of existence are tranquil because they are free from thought, mind and consciousness (sarvadharmā upaśāntā cittamanovijñānavigatena);18) all moments of existence lack characteristics because they are non-originated from the very beginning (sarvadharmā svalakṣaṇavigatā ādyanutpannena);19) all moments of existence are non-originated from the beginning because they are beyond what belongs to the ego and appropriation (sarvadharmā ādyanutpannā amamāparigraheṇa ca);20) all moments of existence are beyond what belongs to the ego and appropriation because they have no owner (sarvadharmā amamā aparigrahāś ca svāmikavigatena);21) all moments of existence have no owner because they are essentially selfless (sarvadharmā asvāmikavigatāḥ svabhāvenānātmanā);22) all moments of existence are essentially selfless because they are originally pure (sarvadharmāḥ svabhāvenānātmāna ādiviśuddhyā);23) all moments of existence are originally pure because they never turn back (sarvadharmā ādiviśuddhā avinivartanena);24) all moments of existence never turn back because their essence has the characteristic of an illusion (sarvadharmā avinivartanīyā māyālakṣaṇasvabhāvena);25) all moments of existence are like an illusion because they have no proper nature (sarvadharmā māyāsamā niḥsvabhāvena);26) all moments of existence have no proper nature because their essential characteristics are unconditioned (sarvadharmā niḥsvabhāvā anabhisaṃskāralakṣaṇena);27) all moments of existence are unconditioned because of being detached from mind and body (sarvadharmā anabhisaṃskārāś cittakāyavivekena);28) all moments of existence have the transcendent essential character because they are beyond characteristics and do not have the character of characterizing something to be characterized (sarvadharmā vivekalakṣaṇā alakṣaṇalakṣyalakṣaṇālakṣaṇa);29) all moments of existence lack characteristics because their defining character is neutralised (sarvadharmā alakṣaṇāḥ svalakṣaṇāniñjena);30) all moments of existence are neutral because they lack place of objective supports (sarvadharmā aniñjitāḥ sthānānālambhena);31) all moments of existence lack place [of objective supports] because they are firmly rooted beyond objectification (sarvadharmā asthānā anālambanapratiṣṭitena);32) all moments of existence are beyond objectification because they lack basis of all (sarvadharmā anālambanā anālayena);33) all moments of existence lack basis of all because they are free from basis of all (sarvadharmā ālayā ālayavigatena);In this way, Śāriputra, the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha elucidated the Dharma-seal called Gaganapariśuddhi to the bodhisatvas, which has thirty-two forms of entrance. Having heard that, innumerable bodhisatvas attained (pratilabdha) the mastery of all moments of existence (sarvadharmādhipatya) and the tolerance (kṣānti) based on the pure cognition (viśuddhajñāna) by supernormal knowledge (abhijñā).
O Śāriputra, from innumerable aeons ago (asaṃkhyeyakalpa), the bodhisatvas in the Mahāvyūha universe have been in accordance with the [perfection of] giving (tyāgānugata) as adorned with generosity (dānālaṃkṛta);have been completely pure in understanding (suviṣuddhabuddhi) as adorned with morality (śīlālaṃkṛta);have been without hostile thoughts towards any living beings (apratihatacitta) as adorned with tolerance (kṣāntyalaṃkṛta);have accumulated all qualities of a Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasaṃbhāra) as adorned with eagerness (vīryālaṃkṛta);have played with every [four] meditations, [eight] liberations, concentrations, attainments of meditation, and supernormal knowledge (sarvadhyānavimokṣasamādhisamāpattyabhijñair vikrīḍitāḥ) as adorned with meditation (dhyānālaṃkṛta);have been free from all habits of vice which is succeedingly originated because of karmic impressions (sarvakleśavāsanānusaṃdhīnāṃ vigatāḥ) as adorned with knowledge (prajñālaṃkṛta);have practiced the protection of all living beings (sarvasatvaparitrāṇavihārita) as adorned with great friendliness (mahāmaitryalaṃkṛta);have practiced never giving up any being (sarvasatvāparityāgavihārita) as adorned with great compassion (mahākaruṇālaṃkṛta);have never ceased to make joy, happiness, and great delight of all living beings (sarvasatvaprītisukhapramuditapratiṣṭhāpanāpratiprasrabdha) as adorned with great happiness (mahāmuditālaṃkṛta);have been punctilious in the practice without interruption, which has made all living beings not to be conceited or depressed (sarvasatvānunnāmāvanāmapratiṣṭhāpanāpratiprasrabdhapratipanna) as adorned with great equanimity (mahopekṣālaṃkṛta).
O Śāriputra, in the buddha-field of the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha, there is a bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja who is resplendent by the splendor of merit (puṇyatejas);without hindered knowledge (jñānadarśanāpratihataḥ);his body was adorned with [the thirty-two] characteristics (lakṣaṇakāyālaṃkṛtaḥ);his friendliness was adorned with [the eighty] minor marks (anuvyañjanamaitryalaṃkṛtaḥ);his voice was adorned with eloquence (pratibhānavākalaṃkṛtaḥ);and his mind was adorned with memory (dhāraṇīcittālaṃkṛta);adorned with recollection (smṛtyalaṃkṛta) because of his learning (śruti);adorned with truth (satyālaṃkṛta) because of his introspection (nidhyapti);adorned with the understanding of meaning (arthagatyalaṃkṛta) because of understanding (gati);adorned with promises (pratijñālaṃkṛta) because of intention (āśaya);adorned with determination (adhyāśayālṃkṛta) because of gaining distinction (viśeṣagāmitā);without any doubt about all moments of existence (sarvadharmaniḥsaṃśaya) as adorned with practice (prayogālaṃkṛta);is without high and low (anatonnata) as adorned with great equanimity (mahopekṣayālaṃkṛta);plays with all supernormal knowledge by with magical power (sarvābhijñārddhivikrīḍita) as adorned with the great supernormal knowledge (mahābhijñālaṃkṛta);is well accomplished through the precious hand of giving (ratnapānityāgābhinirvṛtta) as adorned with merits (puṇyālaṃkṛta);enters the intention of thought of all living beings (sarvasatvacittāśayapraveśa) as adorned with knowledge (jñānālaṃkṛta);penetrates the roots of good of all living beings (sarvasatvakuśalamūla) as adorned with consciousness (buddhyalaṃkṛta);is purified in the region of five eyes (pañcacakṣurviṣayasuviśuddha) adorned with the [divine] sight (cakṣuralaṃkṛta);is endowed with the essence of understanding of all meaning with sound (śabdasarvārthagatisāravat) as adorned with the [divine] hearing (śrotrālaṃkṛta);teaches the imperishable knowledge of the meaning, moments of existence, interpretation, and eloquence (akṣayārthadharmaniruktipratibhānapratisaṃvid) as adorned with special knowledge (pratisaṃvidalaṃkṛta);has obtained the ten powers of the tathāgatas (daśatathāgatabalānyanuprāpta) as adorned with power (balālaṃkṛta);is unsurpassed by all opponents (sarvaparapravādyanabhibhūta) as adorned with intrepidity (vaiśāradyālaṃkṛta);has attained limitless virtues of a Buddha (buddhānantaguṇaprāpta) as adorned with virtue (guṇālaṃkṛta);has proclaimed religion from all hair-pores (sarvaromakūpadharmākhyāna) in accordance with individual suitabilities (pratyarhānugata) as adorned with religion (dharmālaṃkṛta);has attained all qualities of a Buddha on the palm of his hand (sarvabuddhadharmakaratalaprāpta) as adorned with manifestation (avabhāsālaṃkṛta);has illuminated all buddha-fields (sarvabuddhakṣetrāvabhāsa) as adorned with splendor (prabhālaṃkṛta);has been freed from faulty grammar (akṣūṇavyākaraṇa) as adorned with complete teaching;perfected his practice (tatkaraniryāta) as adorned with admonition and instruction (avavādānuśāsanyalaṃkṛta);has shown all liberations by pure magic (sarvaviśuddhirddhivimukti) as adorned with miracles (ṛddhiprātihāryālaṃkṛta);has depended upon the knowledge which is based on itself (aparādhīnajñānāśrita) as adorned with the great praise by all buddhas (sarvabuddhābhiṣṭutālaṃkṛta);has entered into all religion and discipline of a Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmavinayānupraviṣṭa) as adorned with the accumulation of all qualities [of a Buddha] (sarvaguṇasaṃbhārālaṃkṛta);O Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, the great being, Gaganagañja is blessed with (adhiṣṭhita) the display of appearances (avabhāsa) like this.O Śāriputra, the bodhisatva, the great being, Gaganagañja is coming here to see, praise, serve (darśanavandanaparyupāsana) me, and attain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), a chapter of the Great Collection (mahāsaṃnipātaparivarta). Also he is coming with the assembly of all bodhisatvas who have gathered from the worlds of the ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu) for the sake of the joy of religion (dharmaprītā), happiness (sukha), the source of great joy (prāmodyasamudaya), the upholding of the great vehicle (parigrahamahāyana), and the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣika) of all bodhisatvas.[In the Mahāvyūha universe, just after,] the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja, accompanied by, encircled (parivṛta) and followed (puraskṛta) by twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas, said to the tathāgata Ekaratnavyūha: “I would like to go to the world Sahā to honour the Buddha Śākyamuni. I wish to see him and listen to him. Then that Buddha said: “I will grant your wish.” The bodhisatva Gaganagañja touched the feet of the Buddha Ekaratnavyūha, and circumambulated him.Then, by the supernatural display (ṛddhyabhisaṃskāra), by the miraculous performances (vikrīḍita) of the [Ekaratnavyūha] Buddha, [Gaganagañja with the other bodhisatvas] teleported from the Mahāvyūha universe to this Saha universe (mahāvyūhalokadhātau antarhitaḥ sahālokadhātau prātiṣṭhata), in one moment of thought (ekacittakaṣana), and sat down there.They showered flowers, garlands, powders, perfumes, unguents, parasols, banners, flags (puṣpamālyacūrṇagandhavilepanacchatradhvajapatākā) from the Mahāvyūha universe pouring down as rain (varṣābhipravarṣaka).To wit, the moon flower, the great moon flower, the most beautiful moon flower, the sun-light flower (sūryaprabha), the sun-shining flower, the sun-loved flower (sūryakānta) flower, the fair-colored flower (roca), the great fair-colored flower (mahāroca), the brightening-colored flower, the Sthāla flower (sthāla), the great Sthāla flower (mahāsthāla), the beautiful Sthāla flower, the undefiled flower, the impeccable flower, the pure-light flower, the golden-light flower, the space-light flower, the tangible flower, the white great fragrance flower, the non-anther flower, the Aśoka flower (aśoka), the Cadamba flower (nandaka), the golden bark tree flower, the source of happiness flower, the satisfaction of body and mind flower, the one billion fragrances flower, the herbal flower, and the medicinal flower.[The flowers] were adorned with their own splendor and were and produced by immeasurable merits (aprameyapuṇya) and known by bodhisatvas of the ten directions. The great three-thousand thousands of worlds were covered (saṃchādayati) with those flowers, and all congregations of the Lord were filled with flowers up to their knees (puṣpajānumātra).Then the whole assembly (sarvāvatī parṣat), having seen the flowers which have never seen or heard before (adṛṣṭāśrutapūrva), addressed themselves to the Lord:"O Lord, where are such beautiful flowers coming from? (kuto bhagavann imāni evaṃrūpāṇi darśanīyāni puṣpāṇi āgacchanti)"The Lord said (bhagavān āha), “O son of good family (kulaputra), the bodhisatva, the great being, Gaganagañja, having come from the Mahāvyūha universe, brought down such rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa).”Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja together with the twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas, having descended from the vault of the sky, bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, circumambulated him three times, and addressed himself to the Lord. (atha gaganagañjo bodhisatvo mahāsatvas tābhir dvādaśair bodhisatvakoṭibhiḥ saha gaganatalād avatīrya bhagavataḥ pādau śirobhir vanditvā tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya bhagavantam etad avocat)“O Lord, the tathāgata, Ekaratnavyūha asked after your health - if you have little trouble, little discomfort, and little unrest; if you are strong, and living in touch with supreme happiness (bhagavan tathāgata ekaratnavyūho ’lpābādhatāṃ ca paripṛcchaty alpātaṅkatāṃ ca laghutthānatāṃ ca yātrāṃ ca balaṃ ca sukhaṃ cānavadyatāṃ ca sparśavihāratāṃ ca).And he said that the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja and the twelve koṭis of bodhisatvas had wanted to hear about (śrotukāma) the exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), a chapter of the Great Collection (mahāsannipātaparivarta), so please be kind to let them thus return when they are empowered by all such dharmas and equipped with the words of dharma.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja sustained (adhiṣṭhita) the jewel-canopy (ratnacchattra) of ten thousand yojanas high over the Lord’s lion throne in the space, joined the palms of his hands (añjali), bowed down to the Lord (abhivandana), and praised the Lord with these suitable verses (etābhir gāthābhiḥ sārūpyābhir abhiṣṭūya),
1 He who excels in religious teachings and its purpose (dharmārtha), qualities (guṇa), and knowledge (jñāna), who is complete pure, impeccable, pure from his origin, and stainless, who is placed anywhere (apratiṣṭhita) like space (gaganasama) and unmoving (aniñjya), who is of extreme depth (gambhīra) and beyond any range (agocara), I bow to him.
2 Victorious One (jīna) whose absolute body (dharmakāya) is same as the manifested (prabhāvita) body, displayed the handsome (abhirūpa) body as endowed with the beautiful form (surūpa), having produced (prajanita) the compassion (karuṇā) which brings benefits for living beings (satvānugrāhaka), reveals the supreme body which has the characters of hundredfold merits (śatapuṇyalakṣaṇāni).
3 You never say erroneous (nirvikalpa) words and sentences (śabdavacana). Having known the essential character of sentence cannot be grasped because it is like an echo, also having known [the essential character of] words and letters (akṣara) cannot be grasped because they are not eternal (anitya), Loving One, you speak the teaching of the Victorious One by great compassion.
4 You understand (adhigama) the thought and the contents of thought (cittacaitta) of all living beings (sarvasatva), know the essential character of mind (citta) and the stream of thought (cittadhārā) which are like an illusion (māyā), and your mind is not dependent on thought, mind, and consciousness (cittamanovijñāna)
5 When you teach your practice (caryā) to living beings (jagat), there is no change in the body of the Sugata. But still, you teach in a manner in accordance with the power of retaining [in memory], the thinking, the qualities, characteristics and behavior (īryāpatha) [of you listeners].
6 [Because] the concept of mine (mamakāra) does not exist in the dharma of the Sugata, you neither depend (āśrita) nor hold (agrāha) on the dharma. But having known the discipline (vinaya) for all kinds of beings through conceptions (saṃkalpa) of the dharma, you always teach the peerless (annutara) dharma.
7 When the whole assembly regard the body of the Victorious One, his form and distinguishing marks (rūpanimitta) appear as different (bhinna), though incomparable (atulya), and even not part of any particular group (asabhāga). And even though his body is changeless (nirvikāra), beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa), and without distinguishing marks (animitta), he gladdens the assemblies in accordance with their particular way of thinking and their intentions (yathācittāśaya).
8 These all dharmas, having been born from causes and conditions (hetupratyaya), produced by thought-constructions (saṃkalpa) are not produced (asaṃskāra), without an intrinsic nature (asvabhāva). Still the Sugata, having known the mode (naya) of such dharmas, obtained the changeless (nirvikāra), peaceful (śānta), unsurpassable (anuttara) enlightenment.
9 Without discrimination (vikalpa) eliminating the middle (madhya) and the extremes (anta), [you understand] emptiness, that all has a trifling instrinsic nature (riktasvabhāva), is worthless (tuccha) and void (vaśika). Though, knowing the complete purity (viśuddhi) of such dharmas, you explain cause (hetu) and action (karma) to living beings.
10 The dharmas are devoid of a living being (satva), a life principle (jīva), and a person (pudgala). They are pure and beyond words (nāma) like the sameness of space (gaganasamasamatā). Understanding the fact that there is no real self, he awakens living beings to the unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) ambrosia (amṛta).
11 You have practised in order to seek awakening (bodhi) by the power and effort of vigour (vīryabala) during inconceivable (acintiya) hundred koṭis of kalpas (kalpakoṭīśata). But you still attained awakening charecterized by practice without effort, and that is how you have obtained the aim (artha) of practice.
12 Because of the wisdom of concentration (samādhi) on the sameness of dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), you know the sameness of the superior, average or inferior [disciples] (hīnotkṛṣṭamadhyamasamatā, cf. Laṅk). But staying with sameness (samatā) you do not construct (na vikḷp-) [a concept of] sameness, the Victorious One (jīna) is concentrated (samāhita) without change (nirvikāra).
13 The parts of the personality, spheres and fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana) are as an illusion (māyopama); the three worlds are as the reflection of the moon in the water (udakacandropama) without change (acyuta); all living beings are non-existence (abhāva) as a dream (svapnopama). Having realized the fact that all things are like a dream by the knowledge, you teach this dharma.
14 According to what is essentially a conventional expression (vyavahārasvabhāva) you attained the supreme enlightenment (agrabodhi), but, really, that is ineffable (anudāhāra) since there is neither attainment nor non-attainment (prāptāprāpta). You obtain the dharma wheel as you attain awakening, but the turning is really without any distinguishing mark, and as such the enterance into neither turning nor non-turning.
15 Having crossed over to the other side (uttīrya), you save (uttaraṇa) an inconceivable number of living beings (bahusatva); having been released yourself (muktvā), you completely release (vimocayasi) those still in bondage (bandhana); you care for the living beings of the world (jagat) in this incomparable (anuttara) great vehicle (mahāyāna), you place them in extinction (nirvāṇam pratiṣṭhāpayati), which is the sameness of being beyond any way (nairyāṇa)
16 Even though living beings nowhere and never exist, as does not extinction (nirvāṇa), even though there is nothing for living beings to achieve since they are originally pure (ādiviśuddhi), the Buddha still awakens (avabodhayati) koṭis of living beings (bahusatva), having himself become awakened to the understanding that living beings have the character of an illusion (māyā).
17 No forms are seen in empty space, the forms of every living being are also like that. The moments of existence have the essential character of a form being neither form nor non-form (dharmā narūpārūparūpalakṣaṇāḥ), such it is to understand things (artha) as complete transcendence (viveka).
18 [No matter] how much living beings praise (praśaṃsita) the Victorious One (jina) by means of examples (udāharaṇa), it is still an attachment (saṅga) that they see him with respect to the praising. Because the qualities (svaguṇa) of the Leader (nāyaka) are like empty space (gagamasama), the praising for non-duality (advaya) is to praise the Victorious One.
19 The Buddha who awakens (prabodhayati) living beings, transcends objectification (anālambana), and attains the nature of mind (cittatva) which is without mind, I pay homage to him. As all leaders (nāyaka) praise (praśaṃsanti) the Lion Among Men (nṛsiṃha), in that way, I praise the true qualities (bhūtaguṇa) because of suchness (tathatā).
20 He knows all living beings have egolessness (nairātmya), the sphere of dharmas of the Omniscient (viśvabodhi) has the same character, and the character of all dharmas is free from desire (virāga). Because of that, the Leader (nāyaka) having sameness (samatā) is honored.
As soon as (samanantara) the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja said these verses (śloka), the pavilions in the sky of the Mahāvyūha universe has been shaken (pracalita) in six ways (ṣaḍartha).Then a voice resounded from empty space (antarīkṣa), saying, “The bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja has praised in verses (gāthābhigīta) the complete unsurpassable awakening (anuttarāsamyakṣaṃbodhi) which has been fully accomplished by the buddhas in uncountable hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of ages (asaṃkhyeyakalpakoṭīniyutaśatasahasrasamudānīta).But these bodhisatvas cannot see this [awakening] as object (ālambana) even in their dreams (svapna) because of their attachment (abhiniveśa).Having heard, attained and believed in this teaching of the dharma (dharmanaya), whosoever will gradually attain the lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) like that of bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, having praised the Lord with these verses, addressed himself to the Lord (atha gaganagañjo bodhisatvo gāthābhir abhiṣṭutya bhagavantam idam avocat):O Lord, I, having heard the name of this exposition of religion, a chapter of the Great Collection (aham apy bhagavan mahāsaṃnipātaparivartaṃ dharmaparyāyaṃ nāma śrutvā), arrived in this Sahā world system (lokadhātu), to see, honor, serve the Lord and to [listen] this exposition of religion (taṃ bhagavantaṃ darśanāya vandanāya paryupāsanāya dharmaśravaṇāya), and also I came here (ihāgata) to perform the light of dharma (dharmāloka).O Lord, please elucidate (saṃdeśayatu) this exposition of religion to these good men (satpuruṣa) who have a doubt (saṃśaya) in their respective religions (svakeṣu svakeṣu dharmeṣu). May the Blessed Tathāgata please cut off their all doubts (sarvasaṃśaya) and illuminate all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) since you are established (pratiṣṭhita) in the ascertainment (niścaya) in your mind (buddhi).
If, Lord, the Tathāgata gives (pravārayatu) some advice (kathā) about the entrance into the analysis of the dharma (dharmaviniścaya) to me, I would ask a question.Why is that (tat kasya hetoḥ)? The Lord, having obtained the knowledge of non-attachment (asaṅga), is skilled in knowing the excellent and not so excellent abilities in all living beings (sarvasatvavarāvarendriyajñānakuśala);The Lord, having obtained the light, is free from the all darkness (sarvāndhakāravigata);The Lord, having known the meaning (arthajña), is skilled in the knowledge of the division of words (padaprabhedajñāna);The Lord, having known the proper time (kālajña), is always free of faulty prophecy (akṣūṇavyākaraṇa);The Lord, having known the proper measure (mātrakāla), teaches religion accordingly to each individual (yathāpratyarhadharmadeśaka) of all living being;The Lord, having played with (vikrīḍita) the supernormal knowledges (abhijñā), is skilled in the knowledge of ascertainment (viniścaya) of the base of magic (ṛddhipāda);The Lord, having been endowed with the understanding of observation (vyavalokanabuddhimat), throughly shows (ādarśita) the mental behavior of all living beings (sarvasatvacittacarita) as he places it upon the palm of his hand (karatale);Since the Lord has been elevated above (abhyudgata), nobody can look at the top of his head (anavalokitamūrdhatā);The Lord, having been unsurpassed (anabhibhūta), became a hero in the great three-thousand thousands of worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu);The Lord, having awakened through his own power (svayaṃbhū), entered into the state of perfect awakening (abhisaṃbuddha) by himself (svayam) to the all moments of existence without a teacher (anācāryakam);The Lord is the leader (nāyaka), and teaches the right way (samyagmārgadeśika) to those on bad ways (kumārgapratipanneṣu) without any leader (anāyaka);The Lord, having become the king of doctors (vaidyarāja), establishes (pratiṣṭhāpayati) the way into the state without disease (vyādhi) or death (maraṇa) for [living beings] who are involved with this world (lokasanniveśa) covered with desire, defilement, and obstruction (āvaraṇa) from beginningless until endless time (anavarāgra);The Lord, having had power and vitality (sthāmaparākrama), is skilled in the knowledge if what is proper and what is improper (sthānāsthānajñānakuśala), and has obtained the three knowledges (trividya);The Lord has obtained intrepidities (vaiśāradya), extinguished contamination (āsravakṣaya), was perfectly awakened to (abhisaṃbuddha) sameness (samatā), is skilled in the knowledge of purification (vyavadāna) without affliction (asaṃkliṣṭa), and roars the best of lions’ roar (siṃharṣabhanādanādi) to all of the world including the gods;The Lord, having been endowed with the eighteen special qualities of the Buddha (āveṇikabuddhadharmasamanvāgata), has the unattached knowledge (asaṅgajñāna) of the three times (trikāla); The Lord, having purified his body, speech, and mind (kāyavakcittapariśuddhi), has neither error (skhalita) nor rough speech (ravita), and sees every concentration (samāpatti) and the knowledge of liberation (vimuktijñānadarśana);The Lord, who lives with great friendliness (mahāmaitrī), has a mind without hostile intent (apratihata) and same thoughts towards all living beings (samacittatā sarvasatveṣu) because he is endowed with the [divine] sight (cakṣur) which is to see with the light of the same nature as empty space (gaganasama);The Lord, who is established in great compassion (mahākaruṇā), is not shaken by good, evil, pain, or pleasure (sukṛtaduṣkṛtasukhaduḥkha) of living beings because he is endowed with the mind which is the entrance into the sameness (samatā);The Lord, who is equal to all the buddhas (sarvabuddhasama), enters into the non-duality which is the knowing of the equality (dvayasamatājñānapraviṣṭa);The Lord, who is without distinction (nirviśeṣa), practices (prayoga) sameness (samatā) of all living beings since he is purified (suviśuddha) just like empty space;The Lord is free from desire, is satisfied with insight (prajñatṛpta), and free from gain, honor and fame (lābhasatkāraśloka);The Lord is omniscient (sarvajña), and his mode of five eyes (pañcacakṣur) is purified (pariśuddhi) and sees everything;I, having known that the Lord is endowed with such immeasurable virtues, religion, and knowledge of the tathāgata (apramāṇatathāgataguṇadharmajñāna), have a high regard for them, and wish to respectfully (sagaurava) ask you the entrance into the explaining of religion (dharmaprabhāvanapraveśa).Living beings should practice the religion without pride (nirmāṇatā), and ask the Tathāgata for the sake of desire to realize the religion by the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñānābhinirhāra).This had been said, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (evam ukte bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ mahāsatvam etad avocat):“Good, good (sādhu sādhu), son of good family (kulaputra). You asked so many Awakened Lords as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā (aṅgānadīvālikāsama) and attained the prophecy of awakening (vyākaraṇalābha). Son of good family, ask the Tathāgata whatever you may wish. I will satisfy your mind (cittam ārādhayiṣyāmi) by prophecy.”Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Guṇarājaprabhāsa joined this assembly, was seated with them, , and said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu guṇarājaprabhāso nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat).“Son of good family, why do you wish to pose a question to the Tathāgata?” Then again, the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja uttered these verses to that bodhisatva, the great being Guṇarājaprabhāsa.
21 The one who is endowed with the thought and mind (cittamanas) of equality toward living beings, who is established in the sameness of knowledge of well-reflected thought, who is the way of entering into the non-thought (acitta), him, the Lord, I ask for the sake of them [namely all living beings].
22 The one who is free from the impurities of darkness after attaining splendour (ālokalabdha), who cuts off the mind of doubt (vimati) of the doubtful, and therefore establishes [living beings] in liberation (vimokṣa), him, the Sugata I ask for the sake of them.
23 The one whose mind (manas) is perfectly pure (suviśuddha) because of selflessness in oneself (ātmanairātmya), who takes pleasure in the absence of any principle of living being (satva), while still engaging in the cause of all living beings (satvārtha), who makes them free from the twofold selflessnesses (nairātmyadvaya), he is the well defined (viniścita) of religious discourses (dharmakathā),
24 The one who is pure (pariśuddha) in his religious vows (vrata) in the sphere (gocara) of precepts (vidhi), whose thought (citta) is like empty space (gaganasama) bacuse of his purified intensions (śuddhāśaya), and who is not moving (aniñjya), stabilized like Meru, for the sake of them I ask the Lord for his imperturbable activity (amoghakārya).
25 The one who never falls back (avivārya) from firm vigour (dṛḍhavīrya), bravely conquers conceit, the Māra, and enemies (nihatamānamārapratyarthika), and purifies the impurities of vices (kleśa) of oneself and others, I ask the beautiful one (sudarśana) for the sake of them.
26 The one who is pleased to practice the perfections of generosity, morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation, liberation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānavimokṣaprajñāpāramitā), and who [attains] the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) through meditation and the light of liberation, I ask [the Lord] for the sake of happiness and purity (prāmodyāmalārthāya).
27 The one who is established in the emptiness, the absence of distinguishing marks, and the absence of wishful thinking (śūnyatānimittāpraṇidhāna), reveals death and birth (cyutyupapatti) in accordance with his intention (saṃcintya), but who is beyond birth, abiding, and death, I ask [the Lord] about the behaviour of men for the sake of them.
28 The religious discourses (dharmakathā), which are profound (gambhīra) and difficult to understand (duravagāha), difficult to see (durdṛśa) for disciples, isolated buddhas (śrāvakapratyekabuddha) and other beings, but which inspires every living being, I ask the Sugata for them.
29 The one who delights in the well done (sukṛta) and perfected dharma, who is free from the twofold grasping (dvayagrāha) of truth or untruth (dharmādharma), and who constantly takes pleasure in the dharma through the excellent concentration (samādhi), him I ask about the of the space-like subject (ākāśasamārtha) of mind.
30 The one who takes pleasure in the dharma which is to keep the lineage of the buddhas (buddhavaṃsa), who constantly praises the buddhas, who is highly renowned in the three worlds, I ask the Lord in order to worship the one whose virtues are like the ocean (guṇasāgara).
III. 37 Questions
Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu gaganagañjo bodhisatvo mahāsatvo bhagavantam etad avocat):“How, Lord, does the generosity of the bodhisatva become like the expanse of the sky (kathaṃ bhagavan bodhisatvasya dānaṃ gaganasamam)?And, how do the morality (śīla), tolerance (kṣānti), vigour (vīrya), meditation (dhyāna), and insight (prajñā) become like expanse of the sky (gagananasama)?And, how does the accumulation of merit and knowledge (puṇyajñānasaṃbhāra) become like the expanse of the sky (gagananasama)?[How do the bodhisatvas] never forsake the recollection of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Saṃgha, renunciation, morality, and gods (buddhadharmasaṃghatyāgaśīladevānusmṛti) which are instructed by the Lord (buddhānujñāta)?[How do the bodhisatvas] perform his practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā) after having obtained the equality of liberation (nirvāṇasamatā)?[How do the bodhisatvas] know the characteristics of the behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇa)?[How do bodhisatvas] obtain the treasury of the Dharma Jewel of the Awakened Lords (dharmaratnanidhāna), attain (parigrabh-) the characteristics and nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmalakṣaṇasvabhāva) which are understood by the Tathāgatas, how do they mature (paripācaya-) all living beings by their primal purity (satvādiviśuddhi), and apply himself (prayuj-) to the attainment of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma)?[How do the bodhisatvas] attain the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya) after not having regressed from supernatural knowledge (acyutābhijñā)?[How do the bodhisatvas] enter into the profound way of the dharma (gambhīradharmanaya) which is difficult to understand (supratividdha) for all the disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddha)?[How are bodhisatvas] skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala), and free from all views of two extremes (sarvāntadvayadṛṣṭivivarjita)?[How do the bodhisatvas see] the suchness (tathatā) without any differentiation between knowledge (jñāna) and skillful means (upāyakauśalya) as sealed with the seal of the Tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita)?[How do the bodhisatvas] unite with (samavasṛ-) all sphere of all moments of existence (sarvadharmadhātu) after having entered into the way of the sphere of all moments of existence?[How are the bodhisatvas] undisturbed (aniñjya) having made a resolve as firm as a diamond (dṛḍhavajrāśaya), being well established (susthita) in this unshakable great vehicle (mahāyāna)?[How do the bodhisatvas] purify their own sphere (svaviṣaya) after having obtained the sphere of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)?[How do the bodhisatvas] obtain memory (dhāraṇīpratilabdha) without forgetfulness?[How are the bodhisatvas] always supported by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita) and thus having unhindered eloquence (apratihatapratibhāna)?[How do the bodhisatvas] attain the mastery (vaśitāprāpta) in the arising of birth and death (jāticyuti)?[How do the bodhisatvas] vanquish the Evil Ones and all adversaries (nihatamārapratyarthika) after having transcended the way of the four Evil Ones (caturmārapathasamatikrāntata)?[How do the bodhisatvas] become the benefactors (upajīvya) of all living beings after having accumulated immeasurable quantities of merit (aprameyapuṇyasaṃbhāropacaya)?How can living beings be supported with Buddha-activities (buddhakārya) when Buddhas do not appear (buddhānām anutpāde)?[How are the bodhisatvas] not attached to the thoughts and deeds of all living beings (sarvasatvacittacarita) having attained the concentration (samādhi) called the ocean-seal (sāgaramudrā)?[How do the bodhisatvas] transcend all attachments (sarvasaṅgasamatikrānta), their thoughts (citta) being like the wind (vāyu) in the sky (gagana)?[How do the bodhisatvas] obtain the light (ālokalabdha) after having known the way of right action and behaviour (ācāracāritra), and having been freed from darkness (andhakāra)?[How do the bodhisatvas] understand (supratividdha) self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna) not being dependent on any other (aparapraṇeya) and speedily (kṣipram) attain the gnosis of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) from the great vehicle (mahāyāna)?[How do the bodhisatvas] speedily (kṣipram) attain the gnosis of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna) from the great vehicle (mahāyāna)?
IV. 37 Answers
When this had been said, the Lord spoke to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (evam ukte bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ mahāsatvam etad avocat):“Excellent! Excellent, son of good family! Son of good family, you have done well to ask the Tathāgata.That is to say (tadyathā), you will attain the light of all teachings of the Buddha because you are a spiritual friend (kalyāṇamitra) who asked (adhyeṣita) a question not being asked by any living being.You have been clad in the armour of great friendliness and great compassion (mahāmaitrīmahākaruṇasaṃnāhasaṃnaddha), have honored the immeasurable Buddhas (gaṇanāsamatikrāntabuddhaparyupāsita), have been never satisfied to seek religion (atṛptadharmaparyeṣṭi), have transcended all aspects of conceit (sarvamānākārasamatikrāta) by means of the sword of knowledge (jñānaśastra), have constantly strived for the benefit of living beings (satatasamitaṃ satvārthābhiyukta), have transcended the eight conditions of the world (aṣṭalokadharmasamatikrāta), and have attained the gnosis of omniscience (sarvajñajñānasamāpanna) since your mind is like the expanse of the sky (gaganasamacitta). Son of good family, it is difficult to know the end of your qualities (guṇa).Because of that, son of good family, listen well and intently, keep it in mind. I will tell how the bodhisatvas, the great beings, attain these qualities and others. (tena hi kulaputra sṛṇu sādhu ca suṣṭhu ca manasikuru, bhāṣiṣye ’ham te yathā bodhisatvā mahāsatvā imān dharmān anyāñ ca prāpsyante)“Yes, Lord.” The bodhisatva Gaganagañja answered and began to listen. The Lord said to him: (sādhu bhagavan iti bodhisatvo gaganagañjo bhagavataḥ pratyaśrauṣīt | bhagavāṃs teṣām etad avocat)
1. DānaSon of good family, the generosity of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky when he is endowed with the four qualities. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya dānaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)
a) Namely, entering into the purity of all beings through the self-purification (sarvasatvaviśuddhipraveśa ātmaviśuddhyā);b) entering into the purity of generosity with the purity of living beings (dānaviśuddhipraveśaḥ sarvasatvaviśuddhyā);c) entering into the purity of transformation by purification of generosity (pariṇāmanaviśuddhipraveśo dānaviśuddhyā);d) entering into the purity of awakening through the purification of transformation (bodhiviśuddhipravesaḥ pariṇāmanaviśuddhyā).When he is endowed with those four dharmas, son of good family, the generosity of the bodhisatvas becomes like the expanse of the sky (tair caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya dānaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
Then [the bodhisatva] gives a gift by means of the eight purities. What are those eight? (sa aṣṭaviśuddhidvāreṇa tad dānaṃ dadāti).To wit, a) he gives a gift as purified of any conception of self (yad utāhaṃkāraviśuddhaṃ tad dānaṃ dadāti);  The following quotation is from the Śikṣāsamuccaya and its Tibetan and Chinese versions: Ggn(D) 253a5-b7; Śikṣ MS 118a3-118b1; Bendall's edition 270,9-271,3; ŚikṣTib(D) 149a2-149b4; ŚikṣChi(T.1636) 127a25-b10.

Just as the sky is unlimited, in the same way, [the bodhisatva] gives a gift making his mind endless (yathā gaganam aparyantam evam aparyantīkṛtena cittena tad dānaṃ dadāti).

ŚikṣMS: evam asaṃjñi asaṃskṛtam avijñāptilakṣaṇam evam apratijñānan tad dānaṃ dadāti | ŚikṣB: evam asaṃjñi asaṃskṛtam avijñaptilakṣaṇam evam apratijñānaṃ taddānaṃ dadāti | ŚikṣTib: ji ltar nam mkha’ la ’du śes med pa de bźin du ’du śes thams cad kyi mdud pa med par sbyin pa de sbyin | ŚikṣChi: .Just as the sky is unconditioned, the same way, [the bodhisatva] gives a gift without conditions (yathā gaganam anabhisaṃskṛtam evam asaṃskṛtaṃ dānaṃ dadāti).

ŚikṣMS: yathā gaganaṃ sarvvabuddhakṣetraspharaṇam evaṃ sarvvasatvamai(7)trīspharaṇan tad dānan dadāti | ŚikṣB: yathā gaganaṃ sarvabuddhakṣetraspharaṇam evaṃ sarvasatvamaitrīspharaṇaṃ tad dānaṃ dadāti | ŚikṣTib: ji ltar nam mkha’ saṅs rgyas kyi źiṅ thams cad la khyab pa de bźin du sems can thams cad la byams pas khyab par sbyin pa de sbyin | ŚikṣChi: 譬如虚空遍諸佛刹。菩薩大慈縁諸有情廣大行施亦復如是。Just as the sky is imperishable, in the same way, [the bodhisatva] imperishably transforms [the giving] into the imperishability of the succession of the three jewels when he gives a gift (yathā gaganaṃ akṣayaṃ evaṃ triratnavaṃsākṣayatāpariṇāmanayaṃ tad dānaṃ dadāti).  ŚikṣMS: pe | ŚikṣB: pe | ŚikṣTib: No Tibetan ŚikṣChi: No ChineseJust as there is no darkness in the sky, in the same way, [the bodhisatva] gives a gift without the darkness of all afflictions (yathā nāsti gagane andhakāras evaṃ sarvakleśānandhakāraṃ tad dānaṃ dadāti).  ŚikṣMS: ŚikṣB: ŚikṣTib: No Tibetan ŚikṣChi: No ChineseJust as the sky is always radiant, in the same way, [the bodhisatva] gives a gift with a mind originally pure (yathā gaganaṃ sadāprakāśam evaṃ cittaprakṛtiviśuddhaṃ tad dānaṃ dadāti).

ŚikṣMS: ŚikṣB: ŚikṣTib: ji ltar nam mkha’ la ṅa’i ba med pa de bźin du sems can thams cad yid la byed pa thams cad daṅ bral bar sbyin pa de sbyin | ŚikṣChi: No ChineseJust as a magical apparition gives a gift to [another] magical apparition without conceptualization and effort, in the same way, the bodhisatva gives a pure gift as having the essence characterised by illusion, because it is free from the duality of thoughts, mind and consciousness and the hope for any recompense concerning any dharma (yāvad yathā nirmito nirmitāya dadāti nirvikalpo ’nābhogaḥ | cittamanovijñānavigataḥ sarvadharmaniḥpratikāṅkṣī | evaṃ dvayavigamatayā māyālakṣaṇasvabhāvaviśuddhaṃ bodhisatvas tad dānaṃ dadāti).

ŚikṣMS: evaṃ tyāgacittaḥ kulaputra bodhisatvo gaganasamadāno bhavati | ŚikṣB: evaṃ tyāgacittaḥ kulaputra bodhisattvo gaganasamadāno bhavati || ŚikṣTib: rigs kyi bu de lta bur gtoṅ ba’i sems ni byaṅ chub sems dpas sbyin pa nam mkha’ daṅ mtshuṅs pa yin no źes gsuṅs so || ŚikṣChi: 是爲菩薩修行布施波羅蜜多猶若虚空。
Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Pradīpapāṇi came and sat down in this assembly, and addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu pradīpapāṇir nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo bhagavantam etad avocat):“O Lord, which bodhisatva becomes one who gives away in this way? (ko bhagavan bodhisatva evaṃparityāgo bhavati)?”The Lord said (bhagavān āha): “Son of good family (kulaputra), the bodhisatvas, the great beings who are beyond forms (nirākāra) because they are pure of form (ākāraviśuddha);who have the appearance of living beings (satvākāra) because [they see] the purity of living beings (satvaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of the dharma (dharmākāra) because [they see] the purity of the dharma (dharmaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of knowledge (jñānākāra) because [they see] the purity of knowledge (jñānaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of insight (prajñākāra) because [they see] the purity of insight (prajñāviśuddhi);who have the appearance of thought (cittākāra) because [they see] the purity of consciousness (cittaviśuddhi);who have the appearance of the world (lokākāra) because [they see] the purity of the world (lokaviśuddhi);who are formless but manifest themselves in form (rūpa); whose wisdom of non-manifestation is pure;who are beyond darkness (andhakāra) because they illuminate darkness;who reached to the limit of distinguishing marks (nimittaparyanta) by the annihilation of all distinguishing marks (sarvanimittavināśa);who purified their knowledge which reached to its limit (niṣṭhāgatajānaviśudda);who are endowed with inexhaustible patience (akṣayakṣamāvat);who have attained the prediction (vyākaraṇa) that they will understand the knowledge of the Tathāgata (tathāgatajñāna);who have set the boundary [for practice] (sīmābandha) and entered into the state of being determined as a bodhisatva (bodhisatvaniyāmāvakranti);who have attained the consecration (abhiṣekapratilambha) as sealed with the seal of non-retrogression (avinivartanamudrāmudrita);being on the way to attain all qualities of the Buddha, who practice with universal sameness (sarvabuddhadarmasaṃprasthitāḥ samatayā samācaranti)and have practiced good deeds (sucarita).This is the range of the bodhisatvas, the great beings who know the way and characteristics of the behaviour of all living beings (sa sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇavidhijñānāṃ bodhsatvānāṃ māhāsatvānāṃ gocaraḥ),and those good men give a gift in such a way (te satpuruṣā evaṃ dānaṃ dadati).When this teaching had been declared (iha nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne), sixteen thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha)] in the sky-like giving (gaganasamadāna).Then, the Lord went on to speak these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata).
31 Aalways giving a gift with the pure thought for the sake of awakening, [the bodhisatvas] do not expect any reward (vipāka). They, having been pleased and delighted (hṛṣṭatuṣṭa), never feel regret about it. And they, having been liberated, always give a gift.
32 The wise people, having understood the fact that all moments of existence are like an illusion (māyopama), are not attached to their bodies and lives (kāyajīvita). They never hold on them, in such a way, they are certain to attain the awakening (sambodhi niyato mataḥ).
33 Although they give everything (sarvatyāga), they are not unhappy, and in that [generosity], they are not dejected and despondent (aviṣādānavalīna). Because of that, they meditate on the dharmas being just as open space (gagana), and there is no elation or dejection.
34 Since their nature is originally pure, they give a gift with the purity of awakening. Since they are not attached to (asakta) their train of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna), they give a gift without any discursive thinking (niṣprapañca).
35 Giving a gift with the same thought (samacitta) and same mind (samamanas), they give without the three [kinds of discrimination of] superior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭa). Since their intentions (āśaya) are pure (pariśuddha) and undefiled, they do not expect any reward (vipāka).
36 Unlike giving (dāna), body and life are impermanent (anitya), and possessions (bhoga) are just like a dream (svapna) and a lightning (vidyut). Having generated compassion (karuṇā) for the whole world, they give a gift, being undefiled (anupalipta) by the worldly elements (lokadharma).
37 They give the whole of their possessions (sarvasva) for the sake of the purification of afflictions (kleśa), and decide to establish the word of the Victorious One (jina). None of the Evil Ones (māra) are able to get at them (na avatāraṃ lapsyante), and they, having understood in such a way, give away everything (sarvatyāga).
38 Giving by means of ten powers (daśabala) is the root, it is taught. Being based on that, they are endowed with morality (śīla). They, having been established in the qualities of morality (śīlaguṇa), attain meditation (dhyāna), and fulfill (paripūrayati) the qualities of unattached insight (asaktaprajñā).
39 Their thoughts are satisfied with giving (dāna) and discipline (vinaya), and their afflictions (kleśa), having been burned (dagdha), do not arise [again]. Giving is taught for the benefit of oneself and others (svapara), and they are happy because the giving causes benefit and comport (hitasukha).
40 They give a gift for the sake of virtue (kuśala) and getting rid of afflictions (kleśaprahāṇa), for that reason they do not desire to grasp (grāha) [anything]. Giving is not only for the sake of the afflictions of others but also for the sake of awakening which is purity of one’s own mind.
41 The more (yathā yathā) they give [a gift] with the undiminished thought (anavalīnacitta), the more (tathā tathā) they attain the quality of awakening. The more they attain the quality of awakening, the more they satisfy a hundred living beings.
2. ŚīlaThen the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ mahāsatvam āmantrayate sma):
“Son of good family, the morality of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space when he is endowed with the four dharmas. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ samanvāgatasya kulaputra bodhisatvasya śīlaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)To wit, a) the sameness of body (kāyasamatā) being like a reflection (pratibimbopama);b) the sameness of sound (śabdasamatā) being like an echo (pratiśrutkopama);c) the sameness of thought (cittasamatā) being like an illusion (māyopama);d) the sameness of consciousness (buddhisamatā) being like open space (gaganopama).Son of good family, the morality of the bodhisatva becomes like open space when he is endowed with the four dharmas (taiś caturbhir dharmaiḥ samanvāgatasya kulaputra bodhisatvasya śīlaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
Son of good family, the morality of the bodhisatvas becomes purified by these eight qualities. What are those eight? (ebhir aṣṭabhiḥ kulaputra bodhisatvānāṃ śīlaṃ viśuddhaṃ bhavati. katame aṣṭau?)To wit, a) never giving up the thought of awakening in order to purify thought (avirahitabodhicittatā cittaviśuddhayai);  Quotaions from Śikṣasamuccaya and its translations: Śikṣ MS118b6-119a2; B 271,16-272,8; ŚikṣTib(D) 150a2-7; ŚikṣChi(T.1636) 127b20-c2; Ggn(D) 255a3; 255a5-7; 255b3; 256a6-7; 257a1-3.

Further, as for the purity of morality, empty space is pure, and pure is also that morality (punar aparā śīlapariśuddhiḥ | śuddhaṃ gaganaṃ śuddhaṃ tacchīlaṃ).

Then, the Lord went on to speak these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata).
42 [The bodhisatvas] are without distress (atapta) because of undefiled thought through protecting (rakṣaṇa) the morality, and their body and thought are pure because of restraint in speech and mind.
43 The wise people always [remain] in the inner peace (adhyātmopaśama), not having pride of conceit (agarvita) by means of the morality. They are not fixed on the interrupted consciousness and thought, depending on the thought of awakening (bodhicitta).
44 Action (karma), which is neither created (akṛta) nor imagined (acintya) and which is thus not discriminated (akalpita), does not have any form (rūpa) or color (varṇa) such as red, blue, and yellow.
45 The morality is formless (arūpya), untrue (asatya), unmoving (aniñjya), and tranquil (vivikta) just like empty space, and the wise praises it because of the whole, not on the ground of the belief of it.
46 The morality pacifies [minds], pacifies afflictions (kleśa), brings to the completion of the mental quiescence and transcendental analysis (śamathavipaśyana), and guides to the ultimate [liberation].
47 They, who are released from the bondage (bandhana) of actions (karma), remain (sevante) in the morality. Thus the morality causes the liberation (vimokṣa) and becomes the basis of the awakening (bodhi).
48 They, who perform the ascetic practices (dhūta) in a solitary place (araṇya), know how to be satisfied (saṃtuṣṭa) with few desires, and purify their thoughts by meditating (dhyāna) separated from assembly with severe austerity (saṃlekha).
49 By means of the basis of the morality, they reflect on verses (pāda) supporting liberation. Thus they remain in the way of happiness and liberation as adorned with the morality.
50 They are beyond distraction (vikṣepa) and conceited thoughts (manyanā) by cutting off the afflicted view (kliṣṭadṛṣṭi), and they attain the ultimate perfection (niṣṭā) after having spread friendliness (maitrī) just as the expense of the sky (gaganasama).
51 Never having abandoned the certainty of reaching awakening (bodhiniyama), they never make false discrimination (na vikalpayati) of awakening. The wise people who are content in that way attain the perfection of the morality (śīlapāramitā).
gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 23. KṣāntiHow then, son of good family, does the patience of the bodhisatvas becomes like empty space (tatra kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya kṣāntiṃ gaganasamam)?
Son of good family, the patience of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky when he is endowed with the four dharmas. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya kṣāntir gaganasamā bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)a) never responding to abuse with more abuse because the speech is like empty space (ākruṣṭo na pratyākrośativāco gaganasamatvāt);b) never responding to beatings with more beatings because the body is like empty space (tāḍito na pratitāḍayati kāyasya gaganasamatvāt);c) never responding to insults with more insults because the thought is like empty space (paribhāṣito na pratiparibhāṣayati cittasya gaganasamatvāt);d) never responding to anger with more anger because the intention is like empty space (roṣito na pratiroṣayati āśayasya gaganasamatvāt);When he is endowed with those four dharmas, son of good family, the patience of the bodhisatvas becomes like empty space (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya kṣāntiṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
Son of good family, there are eight purities of patience of the bodhisatvas, which are like empty space. What are these eight? (ime kulputra aṣṭaviśuddhayo bodhisatvasya kṣāntir gaganasamā bhavati. kathame aṣṭau?)a) the purity of patience without any hostile intent toward all living beings just as there is no hostile intent in empty space (apratihataṃ gaganaṃ sarvasatvāpratighacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhiḥ).;  ŚikṣMS: apratihataṃ gaganaṃ sarvvasatvāpratighacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhiḥ | ŚikṣB: apratihataṃ gaganaṃ sarvasatvāpratighacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhiḥ | ŚikṣTib: nam mkha’ la źe ’gras pa med de | sems can thams cad la źe ’gras pa med pa’i bzod pa yoṅs su dag pa daṅ | ŚikṣChi: 又如虚空無能過勝。菩薩持戒於有情中無有勝者。b) the purity of patience without any attachment (ananunaya) just as empty space has no desire for profit and honour (lābhasatkāra);c) the purity of patience which is the equal attitude toward all living beings just as empty space is united equally (samaprayogaṃ gaganaṃ sarvasatvasamacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhir;  ŚikṣMS: samaprayogaṃ gaganaṃ sarvvasatvasamacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhir ity ādi | ŚikṣB: samaprayogaṃ gaganaṃ sarvasatvasamacittasya kṣāntipariśuddhir ity ādi || ŚikṣTib: nam mkha’ ni mñam par sbyor ba ste sems can thams cad la sems mñam pa’i bzod pa yoṅs su dag pa źes bya ba la sogs pa’o || ŚikṣChi: 又如虚空清淨平等。菩薩行忍於諸有情平等和合清淨亦爾。d) the purity of unimpaired patience [although] with diminishing body and thought just as empty space is unimpaired (anupahata);e) the purity of patience giving up any bad disposition (anuśayaprahīṇa) just as empty space is without all bad dispositions;f) the purity of patience beyond mind (manas) and objective support (ālambana) just as empty space is beyond mind and objective support;g) the purity of patience which is not produced and does not occur just as empty space is not produced and does not occur;h) the purity of patience filled with friendliness (maitrī) just as empty space is spread (vyapta) on all form and formless realms (rūpārūpya);Son of good family, these eight are the purities of patience of the bodhisatvas, which are like empty space.
Son of good family, there are eight patiences reflecting on (nidhyapti) the dharma of the bodhisatvas. What are the eight?a) the patience of emptiness (śūnyatākṣānti) because there is no destruction (vināśa) of views;b) the patience of signlessness (animittakṣānti) because signs are not excluded;c) the patience of wishlessness (apraṇihitakṣānti) because there is no wish in awakening (bodhi);d) the patience of the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskārakṣānti) because there is no destruction of conditioned things (saṃskṛtavināśa);e) the patience without birth (ajātakṣānti) because characters (lakṣaṇa) are unconditioned (asaṃskṛta);f) the patience without origination (anutpādakṣānti) because there is no arising and abiding (utpādasthiti);g) the patience without being (niḥsatvakṣānti) because there is no destruction of things (vastuvināśa);h) patience truly as it is (yathābhūtakṣānti) because there is no destruction by time (kālavināśa);
Son of good family, those eight are the patiences reflecting on the dharma of the bodhisatvas.As for patience, when thinking “I have patience with those abusing me,” is concerned with the conception of mine, but it is not the patience similar to empty space (kṣāntir itīme mām ākrośayaty api kṣama iti sā mamakārakṣāntir na gaganasamā kṣāntiḥ),when thinking “these abuses are to be endured by me,” this is the conception of self (ahaṃkāra), but it is not the patience like empty space (eteṣām ākrośā mayā kṣāntavyeti sā mamakārakṣāntir na gaganasamā kṣāntiḥ),when thinking “I am not quarrelsome,” this is the patience of sound and voice, but it is not the patience like empty space,when thinking “this is empty and so am I,” this is the patience engaged in mental efforts (manasikāra), but it is not the patience like empty space (ayaṃ śūnya ’haṃ ceti sā mamakārakṣāntir na gaganasamā kṣāntiḥ),when thinking “I should practice patience,” this is the patience of ideation, but it is not the patience like empty space (ahaṃ kṣamiṣyāmīti sā vijñaptikṣāntir na gaganasamā kṣāntiḥ),Suppose there is someone in a great forest of Śāl trees. If he cut a Śāl tree, the rest of trees do not think, “That is cut down but we are not.” This is because they neither have any attachment nor get angry (tadyathāpi syān mahāśālavanaṃ | tasmin kaścid evāgatya śālaṃ chindyāt | tatra teṣām avaśiṣṭānāṃ naivaṃ bhavati | eṣa chinno vayam acchinnā iti | na teṣām anunayo na pratighaḥ);  ŚikṣMS: tadyathāpi syān mahāśālavanan tasmi(119a)n* kaścid evāgatya śālaṃ chindyāt tatra teṣām avaśiṣṭānāṃ naivaṃ bhavaty eṣa cchinno vayam acchinnā iti | na teṣām anunayo na pratighaḥ | ŚikṣB: tadyathāpi syān mahāśālavanaṃ | tasmin kaścid evāgatya śālaṃ chindyāt | tatra teṣām avaśiṣṭānāṃ naivaṃ bhavati | eṣa chinno vayam acchinnā iti | na teṣām anunayo na pratighaḥ | ŚikṣTib: ’di lta ste dper na śiṅ sā la chen po’i tshal yod par la la źig ’oṅs te śiṅ sā la bcad na | de la śiṅ sā la bcad pa’i lhag ma rnams ’di sñam du ’di dag ni bcad do || bdag gis bcad do sñam du mi sems te | de dag la rjes su chags pa yaṅ med do || khoṅ khro ba yaṅ med do || ŚikṣChi: 譬如有人手持利斧入娑羅林斷其枝葉。當知彼樹無有瞋恚。and they are beyond thought-constructions, imaginings and fictions (na kalpo na vikalpo na parikalpaḥ).  ŚikṣMS: na kalpo na vikalpo na parikalpaḥ | ŚikṣB: na kalpo na vikalpo na parikalpaḥ || ŚĪkṣTib: mi rtog rnam par mi rtog yoṅs su mi rtog go || ŚikṣChi: 不生分別誰能斷者。亦不分別誰所斷者。This is the highest purity of the patience of the bodhisatvas, which is like empty space (yaivaṃ kṣāntir iyaṃ bodhisatvasya paramā gaganasamā kṣāntir).  ŚikṣMS: yaivaṃ kṣāntir iyaṃ bodhisatvasya paramā gaganasamā kṣānti(2)r || ŚikṣB: yaivaṃ kṣāntir iyaṃ bodhisatvasya paramā gaganasamā kṣāntir | [iti] || ŚikṣTib: de bźin du gaṅ bzod pa ni byaṅ chub sems dpa’i bzod pa nam mkha’ daṅ mtshuṅs par yoṅs su dag pa’i mchog go źes so || ŚikṣChi: 菩薩行忍亦復如是。是爲 画像菩薩最上忍辱猶如虚空。
Then, in order to clarify this point further, the Lord went on to speak these verses: (atha khalu tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata)
52 The knowledge of cessation (kṣayajñāna) is imperishable (akṣaya) and pure patience since the mind is cultivated without any attachment to any object. Patience becomes the highest thought like empty space when its outside and inside (adhyātmabhāhya) are pure and it fixed anywhere.
53 This body (kāya) is just as a reflection, grass, tree, and wall, (pratibhāsatṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyasadṛśa) and thought (citta) is formless and invisible like as illusion (māyā). This dharma is like empty space, since having no particular basis. Thus body is changeless (avikāra) and mind has no anger (apratighāta).
54 Homage (satkāra) should be beyond attachment and ill-will, it should not discriminate (vikḷp) between superior, inferior. The religious way (yāna) which is just like the ground and threshold (indrakīla), teaches patience in order to purify living beings.
55 Enduring the fact that all dharmas are empty since there is no life, individual self, or living being (nirjīvaniḥsvapudgalaniḥsatva), and not inconsistent with causes, conditions, and effects (hetupratyayakāryāvirodha). Such is the most true and highest exposition of patience.
56 Never responding to the words of abuse, and never getting angry like the thundercloud (meghasvara) in the sky. With a mind purified of self, seeing absolute emptiness, in this teaching I preach patience in order to purify living beings.
4. VīryaHow, son of good family, does the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space (kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya vīryaṃ gaganasamam)?
Son of good family, the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space when he is endowed with four qualities. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya vīryaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)a) even though he strives to attain all roots of good he has the insight that all dharmas are imperfect (sarvakuśalamūleṣv ārabhamāṇo ’py apariniṣpannān sarvadharmān prajānāti);b) even though honouring and serving all Buddhas, he sees clearly the sameness of the true body of the Tathāgata (sarvabuddheṣu pūjopashānam abhisaṃskaroty api tathāgatasya dharmakāyasamatāṃ samanupaśyati).c) even though he brings living beings to maturity, he does not apprehend living beings – as they are already pure (satvān paripācayan api satvān nopalabhate satvaviśuddhatayā);d) even though embracing the true religion of all the Buddhas he never sees the dharmas free from cupidity [as real entities] (sarvabuddhasaddharmān parigṛhṇāty api na vigatarāgadharmān samanupaśyati).When the bodhisatva, the great being, is endowed with those four dharmas, son of good family, his vigour becomes like empty space (tair caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya mahāsatvasya vīryaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
Son of good family, these are eight pure vigours of bodhisatvas. What are the eight?a) vigour to adorn his body (kāyālaṃkāra) but the body is not the objective support since it is distinguished (vikalpita) as a reflection (pratibimba);b) vigour to accomplish proper speech (vāgabhisaṃskāra) although the speech cannot be perceived since it is distinguished as voidness (vaśika);c) vigour to put the thought (citta) into the state of concentration (samādhi) although the thought is not the objective support since it is imagined by the true state of thought (cittadharmatā);d) vigour to attain all aspects of perfection (pāramitā) although they cannot be perceived since they are imagined by the true nature of dharma (dharmatā) which is the extinction of the continuous succession of thought (cittaparaṃparā);e) vigour to attain all dharmas that are wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣyadharmasamudgama) although the awakening is not perceived (na samanupaś-) since it is distinguished as the essential character (bhāvalakṣaṇa);f) vigour to purify Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) although the fields are not perceived since they are distinguished as empty space;g) vigour to retain all learning (sarvaśrutadhāraṇa) while regarding (samanupaśyat) the sound (śabda) as an echo (pratiśrutkā);h) vigour to accomplish all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) although they are not the objective support since they are distinguished as the homogeneity of absolute reality (dharmadhātvasaṃbheda) by nature (lakṣaṇa);Son of good family, those eight are the pure vigours of the bodhisatvas.
Son of good family, the bodhisatvas have two types of vigour. What are these two? (dvāv imau kulaputra bodhisatvānāṃ vīrye. katamau dvau?)Namely, the vigour of application (prayogavīrya) and the vigour of determination (paricchedavīrya).The vigour of application is connected with body, speech, and thought (tatra prayogavīryaṃ kāyavākcittapratisaṃyuktam).The vigour of determination is without grasping, giving up, and its basis (utpādanotsargāvasthita).The vigour of application (prayogavīrya) which is connected with the bodhisatva’s body, speech, and thought (kāyavākcitta) cannot be perceived since it has no basis; the vigour of determination is in accordance with the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu).Thus the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space.
Just as empty space is immaterial (adṛśya) and develops all beings, in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatvas is not established in any dharma and brings all beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati).Just as empty space opens up a possibility for all beings (sarvasatvāvakāśa) being placed in open space (ābhyavakāśika), in such a way, the vigour of the bodhisatvas opens a possibility for all living beings, being free from viewpoints (sarvadṛṣṭivigata) to all beings.Just as empty space raises herbs, trees, and crops (tṛṇavanaspatisaysa) without root and basis, in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatvas generates the qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma), not being established in the root view that the transitory collection [is a real self] (satkāyadṛṣṭimūla).Just as empty space is all-pervasive (sarvatrānugatā) while there is no transmigration of nature (asaṃkrāntilakṣaṇa), in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatva is in accordance with all good qualities (sarvākuśaladharmānugata) while there is no transmigration of nature.Just as empty space is united in the sameness while it displays different figures, in the same way, the vigour of the bodhisatvas is connected with the sameness of all qualities for all living beings while it shows in different kinds of deeds.The bodhisatva sees clearly the sameness of different kinds of accomplishments (sādhaka) and he does not hold it in his mind, even though he has undertaken [the practice of vigour]. In such a way, the vigour of the bodhisatva becomes like empty space.
Then, the Lord went on to speak these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata):
57 After having generated the power by the strength of vigour, you should not hold your body and life (kāyajīvita) dear. Train yourself in the practice of the awakening of the great one (māhātmya) and have an attitude of benefit to living beings.
58 As long as you have accumulated conditioned states in previous existences (pūrvabhava), that long you will stay in cyclic existence, trying to arrive at the qualities of awakening (bodhiguṇa),but you still should not get tired: do generate vigour again and again.
59 Strive to release incalculable numbers of beings, to worship innumerable buddhas, to see countless Buddha-fields, and to discipline numerous evil ones (māra).
60 Strive to give countless gifts, to maintain inconceivable morality (śīla), to train yourself in inconceivable patience (kṣānti), and to practice unthinkable vigour (vīrya).
61 Strive to reflect on unthinkable meditation (dhyāna), to cultivate inconceivable insight (prajñā), to develop inconceivable friendliness (maitrī), and to achieve benefits and merits (guṇā).
62 Strive not to hold life (jīva) and body (kāya) dear, to be liberated from all afflictions (kleśa) and conflicts (kalaha), to understand emptiness (śūnyatā), liberation (vimokṣa) and selflessness (nirātmya), and [to achieve] the nature of greatness (māhātmya) which is selflessness in oneself.
63 Strive for awakening (bodhi) freed from false view (darśana), and for essential nature (svabhāva) which is like an illusion (māya) and mirage (marīci).Strive to attain non-thought (acitta), even though the thought does not exist in reality, and to teach unchanging dharmas.
64 Even though engaged with all beings, he is still free from them; he always strives to recite and read, but he transcends truth or untruth (dharmādharma) and strives for the essential nature of words and letters (śabdākṣarasvabhāva).
65 He explains thousands of scriptures to living beings, even though the qualities of the Buddha (buddhaguṇa) are incalculable. Even though the bad behaviour of living beings (satvacarita) is endless, the wise will always practice vigour [on their behalf].
66 He should be engaged in the behaviour of the endless numbers of living beings, [even though] these dharmas never arise nor disappear (anutpādānirodha). Not being discouraged, the wise men should practice great wave of vigour again and again and guide beings to cultivate such teachings.
5. DhyānaHow, son of good family, does the meditation of the bodhisatva become like empty space (kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya dhyānaṃ gaganasamam)?
Son of good family, the meditation of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky when he is endowed with the four dharmas. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya dhyānaṃ gaganasamā bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)To wit, a) even if his thought is still during in the meditative absorption (pratisaṃlayana), he does not make it as an object of particular reflection (na samanupaśyati);b) while turning back the thought from outside, the external thought (bahirdhācitta) is still in activity, but he has no conception of it (nopalabhate);c) by the sameness of his own thoughts (svacittasamatā) he enters into concentration (samāpatti) on the universal sameness of the thoughts of all beings (sarvasatvacittasamatā);d) and that the sameness of the thoughts is the entering into concentration on the sameness of all dharmas being like an illusion;When he is endowed with those four dharmas, son of good family, the meditation of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya dhyānaṃ gaganasamaṃ bhavati).
Son of good family, there are eight purities of meditation of the bodhisatvas, which are like the expanse of the sky. What are these eight? (ime kulputra aṣṭaviśuddhayo bodhisatvasya dhyānaṃ gaganasamā bhavati. kathame aṣṭau?)a) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in the parts of personality (skandha);b) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in spheres of perception (dhātu);c) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in fields of the senses (āyatana);d) while meditating, one he not meditate abiding in this world (loka);e) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in the next world (paraloka);f) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in the world of desire (kāmadhātu);g) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in the world of form (rūpadhātu);h) while meditating, he does not meditate abiding in the world without form (ārūpyadhātu);Son of good family, those eight are the pure meditations of the bodhisatvas.
Furthermore, reflecting on the thought (cittanidhyapti) is the purity of meditation (dhyānaviśuddhi).What then is the true state of reflecting on the thought (tatra katamā nidhyapticittatā)?With regard to the dharma, being neither conceited nor depressed (anunnāmāvanāmatā);not to praise or blame;no change (avikāratā);no false discrimination (avikalpatā);no increasing;no diminishing;no grasping (agrahaṇatā);not getting rid of (atyāgatā);no darkness (anandhakāratā);no lightness (anābhāsatā);no thought-constructions (akalpatā);no imaginations (avikalpatā);no concepts (asaṃjñā);no mental efforts (amanaskāratā);not oneness (anekatā);not twoness;not twolessness;unmoving (aniñjya);no conceitedness (nirmāṇatā);no discursive thinking (aprapañca);no accumulation (upacaya);no decrease (apacaya);not being cultivated (abhāvanā);no fear (abhayatā);not being dependent on any characteristic or object (sarvanimittālambanāniśritā);not being dependent on the thoughts, that are [the state] of reflecting on the thought (yā cittaniśritatā sā cittanidyaptiḥ).Since reflecting on the thought (cittanidhyapti) is not distracted (na dhāvati) by [visual] forms (rūpa), knowing the eye, [visual] forms, and consciousness (cakṣūrūpavijñāna) he practices meditation purified in respect of its proper essential character (svalakṣaṇaviśuddhaṃ dhyānaṃ dhyāyati).Since reflecting on the thought (cittanidhyapti) is not distracted (na dhāvati) by sounds (śabda), knowing the ear, sound, and consciousness (śrotraśabdavijñāna) he practices meditation purified in respect of its proper essential character (svalakṣaṇaviśuddhaṃ dhyānaṃ dhyāyati).Since reflecting on the thought is not distracted (na dhāvati) by scents (gandha), knowing the nose, scents, and consciousness (ghrāṇagandhavijīāna) he practices meditation purified in respect of its proper essential character (svalakṣaṇaviśuddhaṃ dhyānaṃ dhyāyati).Since reflecting on the thought is not distracted (na dhāvati) by tastes (rasa), knowing the tongue, tastes, and consciousness (jihvārasavijīāna) he practices meditation purified in respect of its proper essential character (svalakṣaṇaviśuddhaṃ dhyānaṃ dhyāyati).Since reflecting on the thought is not distracted (na dhāvati) by tangibles (sparśa), knowing the body, tangibles, and consciousness (kāyasparśavijīāna) he practices meditation to purify one’s own nature (svalakṣaṇaviśuddhaṃ dhyānaṃ dhyāyati).Since reflecting on the thought is not distracted (na dhāvati) by dharmas (dharma), knowing the mind, dharmas, and consciousness (manasdharmavijīāna) he practices meditation to purify one’s own nature (svalakṣaṇaviśuddhaṃ dhyānaṃ dhyāyati).
Just as, son of good family (tadyathā kulaputra), empty space does not get burned in the destroying fire at the end of a Kalpa (kalpoddāha) and is not flooded in the destruction by water [at the end of an aeon] (apskandha), in such a way, the meditation of the bodhisatva does not get burned by any affliction (sarvakleśa) and is not attached to the [four] meditations, [eight] liberations, concentrations, and attainments of meditation (sarvadhyānavimokṣasamādhisamāpatti).[The meditation of bodhisatva] establishes living beings with distracted thoughts (vikṣiptacittā) in the state of concentration (samāhita).If he is in the state of concentration, but ends up in an unpleasant situation, he is not irritated (apratihata).Even thought he always manifests peacefulness (upaśānta) to noble beings (āryajana), he makes flaming efforts (dīptavīrya) in order to bring ordinary people (anāryajana) to maturity.Being in the state of sameness in concentration (samāhitasamatā), he still teaches those with irregular behaviour (asamacaryā) by means of various kinds of teachings.He does not see the irregular (asama) in terms of sameness (samatā), and he does not obstruct (virudhyate) the irregular (asama) with sameness (samatā).Since he is unobstructed (aviruddha), he is called the meditator (dhyāyin) whose thought is just like open space (gaganasamacitta), without any obstruction;he is called a meditator with great insight (mahāprajña);he is called the meditator who is not dependent on consciousness (vijñānāpratiṣṭhita).When meditation is understood in this way, then the meditation of the bodhisatva is like the expanse of open space (gaganasama), which is not dependent on anything (apratiṣṭhitadhyāna).
Then, the Lord went on to speak these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata):
67 They purify the abilities of perception (indriya) by meditation, and concentrate with one-pointed mind (ekāgramanas) by recollection (smṛti). Even though they are not dependent on anything, they still remains absorbed in sameness toward all beings (sarvajagat).
68 Even though they remain in the inner and outer aspects of existence, they are not dependent on the parts of personality, fields of the senses, or spheres (skandhāyatanadhātu). [Staying] in the transcendent sphere (vivekagocara) of tranquility (upaśānta), the wise are always in the state of concentration (samāhita).
69 Since they are always concentrated in universal sameness (samatā), their minds (manas) are similar to (samasadṛśa) the sphere of the dharma (dharmadhātu). Their thoughts are absolutely dissociated (atyantavivikta), but they still manifest it. The wise meditate on everything, but they are not attached to anything.
70 In order to bring living beings to maturity, they teach about the end of death (cyuti) and birth (jāti). They never give up (parijahāti) concentrating (samādhi), they are the way they are by the power of the understanding of thoughts (cittāvabodhi).
71 While in the state of concentration (samādhi) of the sphere without form (ārūpyadhātu), [they still practice] for the sake of the maturation (pariṇāmanā) of living beings. Illuminating the sphere of desire (kāmadhātu), they are dependent on neither themselves nor living beings.
72 The sphere of existence is like empty space (gagana), an illusion (māyā), a mirage (marīci), like a dream (svapna), the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), and a cloud (megha). They, having understood the essential character of all dharmas like this, always remain in the state of concentration.
73 In the sphere of thoughts (cittagocara) with all beings, they engage their though and consciousness in living beings. Since their continuity of thoughs (cittasaṃtāṇa) is unobstructed (anāvaraṇa), they have insight (prajñā) also in the continuity of their own thoughts.
74 By means of skill in meditation (dhyāna) and the supernormal knowledge of magical power (ṛddhyabhijñā), they go to a great number of millions of Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) to make offerings to innumerable Buddhas, with a mind removed from the vice of all ignorance (sarvājñānakleśa),
75 Having trained senses (indriya) and [attained] the tranquility of minds, they become perfected in peaceful meditation (śamatha) without any false discrimination (avikalpa). Having made living being’s minds tranquil, they are always concentrated on the strength of insight (prajña).
76 Even if they are in the state of universal sameness, there is nothing to be attained because it is beyond distinguishing marks (animitta). They who abide in the universal sameness (samatāpratiṣṭhita) are always in the state of concentration.
6. PrajñāHow, son of good family, does the insight of the bodhisatva become like empty space (kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya prajñāṃ gaganasamam)?
Son of good family, the insight of the bodhisatva becomes like the expanse of the sky when he is endowed with the four qualities. What are those four? (caturbhir dharmaiḥ kulaputra samanvāgatasya bodhisatvasya prajñā gaganasamā bhavati | katame catvāraḥ)They are, to wit, a) entering into the purity of all beings through the purity of the expanse of the sky (sarvasatvaviśuddhipraveśo gaganaviśuddhyā);b) entering into the purity of all consciousness through the purity of knowledge (sarvavijñānaviśuddhipraveśo jñānaviśuddhyā);c) entering into the purity of self and living beings, life principle, and person through the purity of sphere (ātmasatvajīvapudgalaviśuddhipraveśo dhātuviśuddhyā);d) understanding the purity of all letters through the purity of meaning (sarvākṣaraviśuddhiprativedhato ’rthaviśuddhyā);When he is endowed with those four qualities, son of good family, the insight of the bodhisatvas becomes like the expanse of the sky.
Son of good family, there are eight purities of the insight of the bodhisatvas. What are the eight? (ime kulputra aṣṭaviśuddhayo bodhisatvasya prajñā gaganasamā bhavati. kathame aṣṭau)To with, a) although they attain all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharmasamudāgamata), they do not stick to the view of eternity (śāśvatadṛṣṭi);b) although they strive to get rid of all bad qualities (sarvākuśaladharmaprahāṇavīryārambha), they do not fall into the view of annihilation (uccheda);c) although they enter into dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśa), they are not contradictory (virudhyate) with the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti);d) although they illuminate four kinds of special knowledge (catasraḥ pratisaṃvida), they are not attached to interpretation and eloquence (niruktipratibhāna);e) although they teach four summaries of the dharma (dharmoddāna), they never see anything (na samanupaśyanti) in impermanence, suffering, selfless, or quiescence (anityaduḥkhānātmaśānta);f) although they teach to enter into action and duties (karmakāryāvatāra), they are free from karmic result (vipāka) and also not disturbed by performing deeds (karmakāra);g) although they are established in the knowledge of teachings (dharmajñāna) which is beyond discursive thinking (niṣprapañca), they elucidate the division of words of all teachings (sarvadharmapadaprabheda);h) they attain the illumination of all teachings (sarvadharmāloka) and teach living beings about impurity and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna).Those eight are, son of good family, the pure insights of the bodhisatvas.
Son of good family, just as the expanse of the sky is not practiced nor not practiced, in the same way, the bodhisatva practices the insight being free from all practice.
Just as the the expanse of the sky is indestructible, in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight which cannot be broken by any demon.
Just as the nature of the expanse of sky is always calm (upaśānta), in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight with understanding and seeing calmness.
Just as the nature of the expanse of the sky is always selfless (anātman), in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight with understanding selflessness.
Just as the nature of the expanse of the sky is not a being (satva), in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight being free from belief in a being (sarvasatvadṛṣṭivigata).
Just as the nature of the expanse of the sky is not a life principle (jīva), in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight being free from belief in a life principle (sarvajīvadṛṣṭivigata).
Just as the nature of the expanse of the sky is not a person (pudgala), in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight being free from belief in a person (sarvapudgaladṛṣṭivigata).
Just as the expanse of the sky is not substantial nor insubstantial, in the same way, the bodhisatva practices insight being free from belief in substance and non-substance.
Further, the so-called ‘insight (prajñā)’ is a word for calm (upaśāntapada) because it is free from the flame of false discrimination (vikalpa),a word for the unchanging because of the purify of own character (nirvikārapadam etat svalakṣaṇaviśuddhatvāt),a word for no thought-constructions because it has no basis (nirvikalpapadam etad anāśrayatvāt),a word for being qua being because it is according to truth (yathābhūtapadam etad yathāsamyaktvāt);a word for truth because it is unchanging (satyapadam etad avikāratvāt),a word for right because it is imperishable (samyakpadam etad avināśatvāt),a word for acute (tīkṣṇa) intellect because it removes bondages (bandhanasamudghāta),a word for contentment because it has the good qualities of the noble (tṛptipadam etad āryaguṇatvāt),a word for penetration because it is well understood (nirvedhapadam etad suparīkṣitatvāt),a word for meaning because it is ineffable (arthapadam etad abhilapyatvāt),a word for sameness because it is without difference (samapadam etad nirviśiṣṭatvāt),a word for firmness because it is indestructible (sāratāpadam etad abhedyatvāt),a word for no darkness because it is not dependent on anything (anandhakārapadam etad apratiṣṭhitatvāt),a word for diamond (vajra) because it completely pierce [all dharmas],a word for liberation because it has been done what is to be done (uttāraṇapadam etad kṛtakaraṇīyatvāt),a word for purity because it is essentially undefiled (viśuddhipadam etad prakṛtyasaṃkliṣṭatvāt),a word for no darkness (anandhakāra) because it has no conception (upalambha) of appearances,a word for non-duality because it is beyond attribution (advayapadam etad asamāropatvāt),a word for perishability (kṣaya) because it is become exhausted and purified (kṣayapadam etad atyantakạyatvāt),a word for imperishability because it is unconditioned (akạyapadam etad asaṃskṛtatvāt),a word for no conditions because it is without connection (asaṃskṛtapadam etad aprayogatvāt),a word for empty space because it is perfectly pure (gaganapadam etat suviśuddhatvāt),a word for the expanse of the sky because it is free from obstructions (gaganapadam etad anāvaraṇatvāt),a word for making things clear (uttānīkaraṇa) in every direction because it abides in abiding (sthitisthiti),a word for no concepts because it is without a proper nature (anupalambhapadam etan niḥsvabhāvatvāt),a word for knowledge because it is free from the duality of consciousness and knowledge (jñānapadam etad vijñānajñānādvayatvāt),a word for uncrushability because it has no contrary (anavamṛdyapadam etad apratipakṣatvāt),a word for no body because it is not brought into being (aśarīrapadam etad anabhinirvṛttatvāt),a word for the thorough understanding because it is [free from] the suffering which conceptually constructed (parijñāpadam etad parikalpaduḥkhatvāt),a word for getting rid of all-pervasive origin of [suffering] because it conquered all tendencies of desires (tṛṣṇānuśaya),a word for cessation (nirodha) because it is without occurrence,a word for cultivation because it is the entering into the way of non-duality (bhāvanāpadam etad advayamārgapraveśatvāt),a word for awakening because of the remarkable (prabhāvita) perfect awakening,a word for the dharma because it is free from desire (dharmapadam etad virāga).Since the light of knowledge (jñānāloka) is the entrance into such a word, and not dependent on others (aparapratyaya), it is called insight.Since it is in accordance with the sky-like teaching among all the teachings of the Buddha (nirdeśa), he accordingly does not produce thought-constructions or fiction (na kalpayati na vikalpayati) even concerning the smallest dharma. That is the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā) of the bodhisatva becoming like the expanse of the sky.
Then, the Lord went on to speak these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata):
77 Insight cuts off wrong views (darśana), darkness (andhakāra) and vices (kleśa), removes the defilement of habitual tendency (vāsanakleśa), reveals (nidṛś-) causes, conditions, effects (hetupratyayakiryā), and eliminates all extremes (sarvānta).
78 Insight is not dependent on self, living beings, individual, and life principle (ātmasatvapudgalajīva), makes [living beings] free from existence and non-existence (bhāvābhāva), and teaches them to practice the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā).
79 Insight is free from vices (kleśa) because it conquers the Evil Ones (māra); it saves [living beings] out of the stream (augha) and releases them; it creates knowledge (jñāna) and related behaviour; and it reveals the highest happiness of liberation (mokṣa).
80 Insight purifies the root of hinderance (āvaraṇamūla); it is the mark of knowledge (parijñā) about the part of personality and spheres (skandhadhātu); it is the liberation from its characteristics since there is no distinction between a characteristic and something to be characterized (lakṣaṇalakṣya). By attaining the insight, he is adorned in the three realms.
81 Pure behaviour (pariśuddhacaryā) is called insight (prajñeti), and therefore it is a behaviour not sullied (sarvalokānupalipta) by anything in the world. [If] he practice to understand the practice of [insight], he who has pure insight will be adorned.
82 The dharma is taught in order to purify the five kinds of sight (pañcacakṣur), to illuminate the five kinds of abilities (pañcendriya), to eliminate the five states of existence (pañcagati), and to makes the five aggregates disappear (pañcaskandha).
83 It is not dependent on this side nor that side, but established in the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātuḥ), same as the sameness of the sky (āntarīkṣa), and it exalts a being in accordance with the knowledge of the Buddha (buddhajñāna).
84 It teaches the way of entering into immortality (amṛta) where all the noble ones have gone, which is free from the duality of gain and loss (alābhalābha), but still does not construct thought-constructions belonging to the middle way of logical proposition (madhyakalpana).
85 Having thought suffering (duḥkha), in this manner, it gets rid of craving (tṛṣṇā). Having shown ways, it declares its extinction (nirodha). It enters into the insight (prajñā) to understand truth (satya), thereby cuts off the past (pūrvānta).
86 All fields of perception (sarvakṣetra) are not being like fields of perception. All moments of existence (sarvadharma) are distinct from (pravivikta) being like any moments of existence. All beings (sarvasatva) are same as beings without the self (anātma). The insight investigating with intelligence knows this.
7. PuṇyaHow then, son of good family, does the merit of bodhisatvas become like the expanse of the sky (tatra kulaputra katamo bodhisatvānāṃ puṇyaṃ gaganasamam)?The qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma) are just like the expanse of the sky, and their potential, the thought of awakening (bodhicittabīja), is also like the expanse of the sky.Because, son of good family, although he accumulates the merit of bodhisatva, he never forgets the thought of awakening (bodhicittāvirahita), and collecting the roots of good (kuśalamūla), he transforms (pariṇāmayati) those accumulations into omniscience (sarvajñātā), and thus establish them (pratiṣṭhita) in being like the immeasurable expanse of the sky.The bodhisatva should think thus: “I will accumulate (abhisaṃkaromi) immeasurable merits in the same way as the expanse the sky is immeasurable.”Since the effort is endless (apramāṇārambha), it increases into an immeasurable good (apramāṇārtha). Here the bodhisatva should strive (yogaḥ karaṇīyaḥ) for immeasurable accumulations of merit (aprameyapuṇyasaṃbhāra);
Through these ten immeasurables (daśāpramāṇa), son of good family, the bodhisatva completes (paripūrayati) the accumulations of merit (puṇyasaṃbhāra). What are these ten (katame daśa)?a) completion (paripūraṇā) of the immeasurable ornaments for the body (kāyālaṃkāra) by fulfilling the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjanaparipūraṇa);b) completion of the immeasurable ornaments of speech (vāgālaṃkāra) by purifying his sphere of speech (svaramaṇḍala) so it is in accordance with all beings (sarvasatvānugatasvaramaṇḍalaviśuddhi);c) completion of the immeasurable ornaments for thought (cittālaṃkāra) in accordance with the thought of all beings (sarvasatvacittānuvartanatā);d) completion of the immeasurable maturation (pariṇāmanā) of living beings through immeasurable behaviour (īryāpatha) of practice and knowledge;e) completion of the immeasurable purity of Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) through immeasurable forms (ākāra);f) completion of the immeasurable behaviour of the Buddha (buddheryāpatha) by infinitely reflecting (nidhyāna) and pondering on the thought of merits;g) completion of the immeasurable embellishment of the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍālaṃkāra) through all practices (sarvacaryā) with all arrangements of the ornaments (sarvālaṃkāravyūha);h) completion of the immeasurable enjoyment (paribhoga) of the circle of hair between the eyebrows (ūrṇa) by accumulating endless offerings (anantayajña);i) completion of the immeasurable, invisible crown of the head (anavalokitamūrdha) by serving teachers (guru) with endless homage and conquering pride (nihatamāna);j) completion of the immeasurable unfailing courage (amoghavikrānti) by adequately grasping (pradakṣiṇagraha) the coming and going (āgatigati) without deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya);Through those ten immeasurables (daśāpramāṇa), son of good family, the bodhisatva accumulates the collection of merit (puṇyasaṃbhāra).Furthermore, son of good family, when the thought of the bodhisatva becomes like open space, all his undertakings (sarvārambha) are infinitely established everywhere since open space is infinite, and thus it is called merit like open space (gaganasamapuṇya).
8. Jñāna
Son of good family, how does the knowledge of the bodhisatva becomes like open space (kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya jñānaṃ gaganasamam)?Having pervaded the thoughts of all beings (sarvasatvacitta) by knowledge (jñāna), he knows the impassioned thought of all beings truly as it is, as an impassioned thought (sarvasatvacittaṃ sarāgaṃ cittam api sarāgaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought full of aversion truly as it is, as a thought full of aversion (sadoṣaṃ cittam api sadoṣaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought full of bewilderment truly as it is, as a thought full of bewilderment (samohaṃ cittam api samohaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he knows the thought full of impurity truly as it is, as a thought full of impurity (sopakleśaṃ cittaṃ api sopakleśaṃ cittaṃ yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti);he never deviates from (avicalita) the nature of all moments of existence (dharmāprakṛti) which is without desire (rāga), and teaches religion for other beings (parasatvapudgala) so that they overcome their desire;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of existence which is without aversion (dveṣa), and teaches religion for other beings so that they overcome their aversion;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of existence which is without bewilderment (moha), and teaches religion for other beings so that they overcome their bewilderment;he never deviates from the nature of all moments of existence which is without impurity (upakleśa), and teaches religion for other beings so that they overcome their impurity;he teaches religion in order to purify the vices of desire, aversion, and bewilderment (rāgadveṣamohakleśa);he never looks down on the thought of desire, aversion, bewilderment, and impurity (rāgadveṣamohopakleśa); and he also never looks up to the thought free from desire, aversion, bewilderment, and impurity.Why is that? Because bodhisatva understands the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātu) from the viewpoint of non-duality (advaya), in the way that the sphere of all moments of existence is the same as the sphere of desire (rāgadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere of aversion (dveṣadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere of bewilderment (mohadhātu); the sphere of all moments of existence is the sphere of vices (kleśadhātu).For that reason, since all moments of existence are called the gathering of the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamavasaraṇa), there is no going or no not-going in the sphere of all moments of existence;and since all moments of existence belong to the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātvanugata), he who knows the sphere of self (ātmadhātu) also knows the sphere of all moments of existence.Thus the sphere of all moments of existence and the sphere of self are not two (advaya).Why is that? Because the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), the sphere of all moments of existence is also pure (dharmadhātuviśuddhi).In that way all moments of existence are pure, and this purity is illumination;the illumination is without any upper cover (ābhyavakāśika);where there is no upper cover (ābhyavakāśika), there is no space (avakāśa) for any distinguishing marks (nimitta);where there are no distinguishing marks (animitta) there is no basis at all, and being without any basis is the same as open space.In that way he is in accordance with knowledge, and because of the knowledge, he is also in accordance with all moments of existence. That is the knowledge of the bodhisatva becoming like open space.
9. BuddhānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized by the Lord for bodhisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ).a) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of morality (śīla), he never gives up (asaṃpramoṣata) unsullied morality (anāsravaśīla);b) while recollecting the Buddha in the perspective concentration (samādhi), he is changeless (nirvikāra) concerning the sphere of the moments of existence (dharmadhātu) being always same;c) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of insight (prajñā), he is free from thought-constructions (nirvikalpa) since there is no activity in all moments of existence (sarvadharmāpracāra);d) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of liberation (vimukti), he does not stay in the secondary-thought (dvitīyacitta);e) while recollection the Buddha from the perspective of the vision of the knowledge of liberation (vimuktijñānadarśana), he is not attached (asakta) to any knowledge (sarvajñāna);f) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of power (bala), he is not moving (āniñjya) concerning the knowledge which is equanimous in all three times (tryadhvasamata);g) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of fearlessness (vaiśāradya), he does not stay with any defilement (sarvāsravaḥ sārdhaṃ na saṃvasati);h) while recollecting the Buddha from the perspective of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma), he does not have any false discrimination in the sameness of the sphere of all moments of existence (dharmadhātusamatāṃ na vikalpayati).Furthermore, the recollection of the Buddha is not to see (na samanupaśyati) the Lord from his material body (rūpasvabhāva), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through understanding the nature of the material form;it is not to see the Lord from his feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through understanding their nature;it is not to see the Lord from his parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana), but to be in accordance with the knowledge of recollection through understanding their nature.Again, since he understands the essence of all moments of existence (sarvadharmasvabhāvajñānena), the recollection of the great insight (mahāprajñānusmṛti) is beyond any mental effort (sarvamanasikāra) and the arising (paryuttāna) of any viewpoint (sarvadṛṣṭi);Since in this way recollection is pure (anāvila), the knowledge of the application of awareness (smṛtyupsthānajñāna) is called the recollection of the Buddha which is taught by the Lord.Further, the recollection of the Buddha is not to be attached to any of the Lord’s ways of behavior (sarveryapatha), to wit: standing (sthita), walking (caṃkrama), sitting (niṣadya), sleeping (śayana), going (gati), coming (āgati), speaking (pravyāhāra), and not speaking (apravyāhāra).Since there is no attachment, he does not recollect recollection nor recollect non-recollection.Since there is no mental effort in recollection (asmṛtimanasikāra), he does not recollect the Buddha in the perspective of form, distinguishing marks or any state of things (rūpalakṣaṇadharmatā).There is no involvement with any distinguishing mark or object (sarvanimittālambanāsamudācāra), son of good family, this is therefore the recollection of the Buddha, which is authorized by the Lord.

DharmānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of the Dharma, which is authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvānām buddhānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.The Dharma is without attachment (arāga),and he who is attached to any dharma is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is without basis (anālaya),and where there is no the practice of the Dharma, there is no the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is calm (upaśānta), and he whose thought and mind are burning (jvalana) is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is beyond distinguishing marks (animitta), and he who pursues distinguishing marks (nimittānusāra) is without the recollection of the Dharma.The Dharma is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), and he who is dependent on the conditioned place (saṃskṛtapratiṣṭhāpanapratiṣṭhita) is without the recollection of the Dharma.Further, the recollection of the Dharma is to see the fact that there is no origination of any conditioned thing (sarvasaṃskārānutpādadarśana), and to enter into faultless reality (samyaktvaniyamapraveśa).The bodhisatva, knowing that all dharmas are not originated because of their intrinsic nature (sarvadharmāṃ svabhāvānutpattiṃ viditvā), attains the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣāntipratilabdha).This state of being is the true Dharma (bhūtadharma).He who understands thus understands all dharmas, since it is the way in which the people on the path of training or on the path beyond training, the isolated buddhas, the bodhisatvas, and the perfectly awakened one (śaikṣāśaikṣapratyekabuddhabodhisatvasamyaksaṃbuddha) understand all dharmas.Such concentration (samāhita) is the liberation of all the holy (sarvāryavimukti), and in that there is no involvement with any dharma (sarvadharmāsamudācāra).The absence of involvement with any dharma is the recollection of the Dharma, which is authorized by the Lord (buddhānujñāta).
10. SaṃghānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection on the Saṃgha, which is authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya saṃghānujñātā buddhānusmṛtiḥ)?.What we called the Saṃgha is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), and it cannot to be recollected in the perspective of conditioning (abhisaṃskāra).Where there is no involvement (samudācāra) with the actions of body, speech or mind (kāyavāṅmanaskarma), it is called unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra).Thus what we called conditioned (saṃskṛta) is a mere denomination (prajñapti) and convention (vyavahāra);The unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) is the destruction of all denominations (sarvaprajñaptisamudghāta), and the transcendence of all conventions (sarvavyavahārasamatikrānta).Son of good family, this is the recollection of the congregation, which is authorized by the Lord.
11. TyāgānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of renunciation, which is authorized by the Lord for the sake of the bodhisatvas? (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā tyāgānusmṛtiḥ)What we called renunciation (tyāga) is to abandon and renounce any material thing (sarvopadhi).Why is that? There is not any dharma that is to be renounced,and any dharma to be renounced does not appear.That which is not to be entangled in any dharma (sarvadharmāgrahaṇa) is the highest renunciation;that which is not entangled is without renunciation;that which is without renunciation is without haughtiness (amanyanatā);that which is without haughtiness is without apprehending (anupalambha);that which is without apprehending is without [mental] activity (apracāra);that which is without [mental] activity is without information by thinking (cittāvijñapti);where there is no information by thinking (cittāvijñāpti), there is no basis in consciousness (vijñānāniśraya);that which is without basis in consciousness is the recollection of renunciation (tyāgānusmṛti) authorized by the Lord.This renunciation of the bodhisatva is to transform into omniscience (sarvajñapariṇāmana), and the omniscience is the same as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā).Even though staying in sameness (samatāsthita) he recollects renunciation; even though he does not recollect any moment of existence, he transforms into awakening (bodhi).Why is that?Since in omniscience (sarvajñatā) there is no duality of truth and untruth (dharmādharma), the non-duality (advaya) is without any mental effort (manasikāra).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva cultivating the knowledge of the Dharma (dharmajñānaprayukta) practices the recollection of renunciation which is authorized by the Lord.
12. ŚīlānusmṛtiSon of good family, how does the recollection of morality of bodhisatva becomes like open space (tatra kathaṃ kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtir gaganasamā)?.What we called ‘morality (śīla)’ is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), unsullied (anāsrava), no wishful thinking (apraṇidhāna), effortless (anābhoga), and it accomplishes vows (siddhavrata), fulfils the vows (vrataparipūri), and does not have essential characteristic of information (vijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is established by concentration (samādhi), it is not established in the object of thought (cittopalaṃbha).Since it is the root of insight (prajñāmūla), it is without essential characteristic of discursive thinking (niḥprapañcalakṣaṇa).Since it is the outcome of liberation (vimuktiniṣyanda), it is not distinguished by duality (advayaprabhāvita).Since there is no visual form, it is praised by the wise (pāṇḍitapraśaṃsita).Since it appeases vices (kleśapraśamana), there is no essential characteristic of recognition (aprativijñaptilakṣaṇa).Since it is in accordance with all happiness (sarvasukhānugata) and is not generated by the contrary (pratipakṣaprabhāvita), while recollecting this morality, there is no impurity (anāvila) in the recollection. Son of good family, this is what is called the recollection of morality which is authorized by the Lord (sa kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā śīlānusmṛtiḥ).
12. DevānusmṛtiWhat then, son of good family, is the recollection of gods, which is authorized by the Lord for bodhisatvas (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya buddhānujñātā devānusmṛtiḥ)?.It is the recollection of two assemblies of gods (devanikāya). What are these two (katame dve)?The gods of the Pure Abode (śuddhāvāsadeva), and the bodhisatvas hindered by only one birth (ekajātipratibaddhabodhisatva), who dwell in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha).In that the bodhisatva recollects the gods of the Pure Abode (śuddhāvāsadeva).Further, the bodhisatvas who are hindered by only one birth (ekajātipratibaddhabodhisatva), and who dwell in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha) recollect ten qualities as the summit (mūrdhan). What are those ten qualities?
To wit, a) the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā) as the summit (mūrdhan) of all perfections (sarvapāramitā);b) the supernormal knowledge without retrogression [as the summit] of all supernormal knowledges (sarvābhijñā);c) the stage of consecration (abhiṣekabhūmi) [as the summit] of all stages (sarvabhūmi);d) the right view (samyagdṛṣṭi) and concentration (samādhi) without retrogression [as the summit] all wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣikadharma);e) the meaning and eloquence without obstruction (anācchedyārthapratibhāna) [as the summit] of special knowledges (pratisaṃvid);f) the way into unattached knowledge (asaṅgajñānapraveśa) [as the summit] of all knowledges (sarvajñāna);g) the knowledge of understanding superior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭapraveśajñāna) [as the summit] of all his faculties (sarvendriya);h) following the knowledge of light (ābhāsajñānānugamana) [as the summit] of power and fearlessness (balavaiśāradya);i) the sight of the Buddha (buddhacakṣur), seeing all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) as being in the palm of his hand (karatalagata), [as the summit] of all kinds of sights (sarvacakṣur);j) the perfect awakening (abhisaṃbodhi) through insight (prajñā) associated with a moment of thought (ekacittakṣaṇasamāyukta) [as the summit] after sitting on the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍaniṣadana) - they recollect such ten qualities as the summit.This recollection is not disturbed by any particular viewpoint (dṛṣṭi), manifestations of bad dispositions (anuśayaparyutthāna), mental efforts (manasikāra), or discursive thinking (prapañca), so there is no impurity (anāvila) and thus the recollection of gods is, son of good family, called the recollection of gods, which is authorized by the Lord.
15. BodhisatvacaryāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva perform his practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā) after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā)?The extinction (nirvāṇa) is the pacification of all vices (sarvakleśapraśamana),the allaying of every feeling (sarvavedanāpratipraśrambhaṇa),the pacification of all objects (sarvālambanapraśamana),and no connection (pratisaṃdhi) with the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana).Thus the good man (satpuruṣa), having obtained the sameness of extiction (nirvāṇasamatā), playfully employs (vikrīḍita) the great compassion (mahākaruṇā), means and insight (prajñopāya), and knowledge (jñāna) of the former lives (pūrvanivāsa);he is sustained by the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhitai);he cultivates insight (prajñā) and knowledge (jñāna);he purifies cultivation (bhavānā) by means of the clear presence of manifestation (bhāvānapariśuddhi);he depends on concentration (samādhi) which is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) with illusion (māyā);The vices by which he might produce existence and bonds of existence, these he does away with (yaiḥ kleśaḥ saṃsāraṃ saṃsārabandhanaṃ vā prabhāvayati tān prajahāti), and the knowledge by means of which he teaches extinction, in that he excels (yena jñānena nirvāṇaṃ deśayati tatra vaśitāprāptaḥ), thus he is born from non-existence and originated form non-origination (anutpādotpanno ’bhūtabhūtaḥ).Even though he is established in the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatāsaṃprasthita), he still does not interrupt bringing living beings to maturity (satvaparipāka).This, son of good family, is the gate of knowledge (jñānamukha), called the development of two approaches (yamakapariṇāma), [namely the great compassion (mahākāruṇā) and expedient means (upāya)] of the bodhisatvas, and even though the bodhisatva is placed in the gate of knowledge after having obtained the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā), he still performs the practice of a bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).
16. CaritalakṣaṇaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva know4 the essential character of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇa)?There, son of good family, are eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living beings (caturaśītisatvacaritasahasra), and these are the basic words of a summary (mūloddānapada).The behaviour of all living beings, which is immeasureable (sarvasatvacaritāpramāṇa), unthinkable (acintya), and ineffable (anabhilāpya), is known by the knowledge of a Buddha (buddhajñāna), but not by the knowledge of the disciples, the isolated buddhas (śrāvakapratyekabuddhajñāna), or the knowledge of bodhisatva (bodhisatvajñāna).Thus the bodhisatva penetrates the essential character of behaviour of all living beings (sarvasatvacaritalakṣaṇānupraveśa) through the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna) and his own knowledge (ātmajñāna).The behaviour’s essence (svabhāva), essential character (lakṣaṇa), the essential character of cause (hetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of condition (pratyayalakṣaṇa), the essential character of productive cause (karaṇahetulakṣaṇa), the essential character of combination (sāmagrīlakṣaṇa), the essential character of difference (nānātvalakṣaṇa), the essential character of discordance (vilakṣaṇa), the essential character of passion (rāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character of aversion (dveṣalakṣaṇa), the essential character of delusion (mohalakṣaṇa), the essential character of the three together (sabhāgalakṣaṇa), the essential character of hell-beings (nirayalakṣaṇa), the animal world (tiryagyonilakṣaṇa), the essential character of the world of the lord of death (yamalokalakṣaṇa), the essential character of gods (devalakṣaṇa), the essential character of human being (manuṣyalakṣaṇa), the essential character of the entrance into the fixed course of disciples (śrāvakaniyāmāvakranti), the essential character of the entrance into the fixed course of isolated buddhas (pratyekabuddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa), the essential character of the entrance into the fixed course of the buddhas (buddhaniyāmalakṣaṇa), the essential character of distant cause, the essential character of intermediate cause (anantaryalakṣaṇa), and the essential character of immediate cause - he knows all the essential characters of behaviour truly as they are (yathābhūtaṃ prajānāti), and there is no fault at all (anavadya) in his understanding (sarvajñāna).
17. DharmaratnanidhānaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva grasp the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords?Son of good family, the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords is imperishable (akṣaya).Thus, as many as are the entrances into the essential character of behaviour in all living beings, so many are the entrances into knowledge which is the gate into the treasury of the Dharma Jewel of the Awakened Lords (yāvantaḥ sarvasatvānāṃ caritalakṣaṇānupraveśās tāvad api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānamukhajñānapraveśāḥ).Just as the behaviour of living beings is imperishable and endless, in the same way, the treasury of the Dharma Jewel of the Awakened Lords is also imperishable and endless (yathā satvacaritam akṣayam anatam evam api buddhānāṃ bhagavatāṃ dharmaratnanidhānāny akṣayāṇi anatāni).From the night (rātri) when the Tathāgata attained awakening (bodhiprāpta) to the night of his extinction (parinirvāṇa), the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) has been explained, is being explained, and will be explained by the Tathāgata. All of them are what they really are (tathatā), not different from what they are (avitathatā), and nothing else but what they are (ananyathā).Why is it called ‘such’ (kasmāt tatheti)? Since it is the entrance into the peace of suchness, it is called 'such’ (tathatāśāntisaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti).Why is it called ‘suchness without error’ (kasmāt avitatheti)? Since it is the entrance into the highest truth, it is called ‘suchness without error.’ (paramārthasatyasaṃprasthitatvāt tatheti)Why is it called ‘suchness that is not other’ (kasmāt ananyatatheti)? Since he seeks nothing else but the essential nature (svabhāva), there is no other.Further, as for the treasury of the Dharma Jewels of the Awakened Lords, even though living beings of a system of threefold thousand great thousand worlds (trisāhasramahāsahasralokadhātuparyāpanna) were as learned as (bāhuśruta) Ānanda, all of them would not be able to understand even a syllable (akṣara) in hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons (kalpakoṭīśatasahasra); and further they would not be able to teach even a single meaning (ekārtha) - such a true teaching (yathābhūtadeśanā) is the treasury of Dharma Jewels belonging to the Awakened Lords.The bodhisatvas, having grasped it, do not forget (saṃpramoṣayati) any letter or lose any meaning (artha), and they please (ārādhyati) all living beings, gratify (ārāgayati) all the Buddhas, vanquish all the Evil Ones (sarvamāra), subjugate all other heretics (sarvānyatīrthika), and appease all vices (sarvakleśa). Thus they understand the Dharma Jewel Words.In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva grasps the treasury of the Dharma Jewel (dharmaratnanidhāna) of the Awakened Lords.
18. DharmasvabhāvaBut further, son of good family, in the perspective of the essential character of the dharma (dharmasvabhāva), the bodhisatva may grasp an essential character, thinking: “I have fully understood (abhisambuddha) the dharmas.”But, how then has the Tathāgata understood (abhisaṃbuddha) the dharmas?[It is like this:] their nature is [like] illusion (māyāsvabhāva) because it is not established in reality (apariniṣpanna);their nature is [like] a dream (svapna) because it transcends perceptual fields (viṣayātikrantatarayogena);their nature is [like] a mirage (marīci) because there is no birth (atyantānutpanna);their nature is [like] a reflected image (pratibhāsa) because it is unchanging (asaṃkrānti);their nature is [like] a reflection (pratibimba) because it is devoid of intrinsic nature (niḥsvabhāva);their nature is empty (sūnya) because it is dependent (aparādhīna);their nature is without distinguishing mark (animitta) because it is beyond thought-constructions (nirvikalpa);their nature is wishless (apraṇihita) because it is not attached to thoughts (cittāsaṅga);their nature has no desire (rāga) because it is free from all desires (sarvarāgavigata);their nature is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta) because there is no any calculation (asaṃkhya).Thus, son of good family, based on the information (prajñapti) in conventional expressions (vyavahāra) of others I was fully awakened (abhisaṃbuddha) to such dharmas,but still, their essential character (dharmasvabhāvalakṣaṇa) is inexpressible in words.Even though the bodhisattva, who wishes to grasp the dharmas, is fully awakened to dharmas with such an essential character, he still teaches other beings (parasatvapudgala) by means of syllables and explanations of language (akṣaranirukti).
19. SatvādiviśuddhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva bring all living beings to maturity (paripācayati) given the fact that they are originally pure (satvādiviśuddhi).The realm of living beings (satvadhātu), son of good family, is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi), and thus their roots have no basis (avastuka).The bodhisatva, son of good family, having understood that the roots of all dharmas are completely cut off, brings living beings to maturity, and then he does not hold the view of a self (ātmadṛṣṭi), the view of a living being (satvadṛṣṭi), the view of a life principle (jīvadṛṣṭi), or the view of a person (pudgaladṛṣṭi).Again he thinks (punas tasyaivaṃ bhavati): “what is called ‘living being (satva)’ is a misunderstanding (viparyasta). Because of being occupied (paryavasthāna) with the view of cause (hetudṛṣṭi), ignorance (avidyā), existence (bhāva), thirst (tṛṣṇā), and unreal mental constructions (abhūtaparikalpa), it is called ‘living being.’”But the bodhisatva still teaches the Dharma (dharmaṃ deśayati) to living beings in order to get rid of vices which originate from misunderstanding (viparyāsasamutthitakleśaprahāṇa), and he does not forget (na vipraṇāśayati) substances (bhāva).Since he is devoid of a living being (niḥsatva), and detached from a living being (satvaviveka), he brings living beings to maturity.Thus the bodhisatva brings living beings to maturity (sarvasatvān paripācayati) by the original purity (ādiviśuddhi).
20. DharmaprayogaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva collect all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya) by thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga)?‘Thorough (yoniśaḥ)’ means the entrance into dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśa). Why is that?As is the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya), thus the fruit (phala) is produced (abhinirvṛtta).The generosity (dāna) is the cause of great comforts (mahābhogahetu),and the bodhisatva, having transferred that giving into omniscience (tyāgaṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā), fulfils the perfection of giving (dānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The morality (śīla) is the cause of birth among gods and men (devamānuṣajātihetu),and the bodhisatva, being born among gods and men, makes living beings adopt moral ways (śīlam avatārayati);he, having transferred the maintaining morality into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The tolerance and mildness (kṣāntisauratya) are the causes which are the ornaments of body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkārahetu);the bodhisatva practices what is good for oneself and for others (ātmaparahita) through the ornaments of body, speech and thought (kāyavākcittālaṃkāra);he, having transferred the basis of wishing to help and tolerance into omniscience (hitakāmakṣāntyavasthāṃ sarvajñatāyaṃ pariṇāmaitvā), fulfils the perfection of tolerance (kṣāntipāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The vigour (vīrya) is the cause of collecting all Buddha learning (sarvabuddhaśruta);The bodhisatva makes an effort (vīryam ārambya), attains all roots of good (kuśalamūlaṃ samādāpya), transfers the vigour of attaining all roots of good into omniscience, and fulfils the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).The meditation (dhyāna) is the cause of happiness and noble birth (pramuditacittājāneyahetu);the bodhisatva completes the accumulations for peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra) with happiness and noble birth (pramuditacittājāneya);he, having transferred the accumulations of peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāra) into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitāṃ paripūrayati).Learning (śruta) is the cause of great insight (mahāprājñahetu);the bodhisatva, not being entangled in the preconceived viewpoints (upalaṃbhadṛṣṭikāgrahaṇa), having transferred the learning without apprehending (anupalambhaśruta) into omniscience, fulfils the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitāṃ paripūrayati).In the same way with all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharma), whatever the cause of good qualities (kuśaladharmahetu) accumulated, its effect (phala) will appear without effort (anābhoga).Further, the cause and conditions (hetupratyaya) are called thorough mental effort (yoniśomanasikāra).With regard to what is called ‘thorough (yoniśaḥ)’, there is the self in every fundamental moment of existence.Just as there is no self in oneself, so there is no self in any moment of existence.Just as the self is empty (śūnya), so all moments of existence are empty.Just as the self is merely a word (nāma), so all moments of existence are merely words.Thus the thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga) of the bodhisatva is to be equally associated with all moments of existence.That which is the same as all moments of existence (sarvadharmasamatā) is the same as all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamatā), and thus the thorough practice of the bodhisatva is to attain the qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma).
21. AcyutābhijñāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva never lose his supernormal knowledge (acyutābhijñā) after having attained the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya)?Son of good family, if a certain ascetic or a brahmin (kulaputraśramaṇabrāhmaṇa) produces the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) without having overcome the view that there is a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭi), he will loose his supernormal knowledge.However the bodhisatva, having overcome sixty-two doctrinal viewpoints (dvāṣaṣṭidṛṣṭigata) derived from the root view that there is a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭimūla), produces the supernormal knowledge in the absence of any attachment of view;he is endowed with knowledge (jñānavān), insight (prajñāvān), consciousness (buddhivān), tolerance (kṣāntivān), morality (śīlavān);he, having entered into concentration, is detached from body and mind (kāyacittavivikta);he approaches his inner and does not move around his outer through such knowledge (jñāna);he is endowed with the object that there is no object;he is endowed with disciplined thoughts (ājāneyacitta) and joyous thoughts;he examines [things] by means of thorough examination (suniścita);he has supremely pure consciousness which is not disturbed by vices (kleśa), having attained the light (ālokalabdha).there is no obstruction (vitimira) in his knowledge (jñāna);he accumulates merits (puṇyasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates knowledge (jñānasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāropacaya);he accumulates expanded vision (vipaśyanasaṃbhāropacaya);he is stabilized by his generosity (dāna);he is adorned with morality (śīlālaṃkṛta);he is clad in the armor of tolerance (kṣāntisaṃnāha);he is equipped with the mail of effort (vīrya);he is established in meditation (dhyānapratiṣṭhita);he is endowed with the consciousness that cultivates insight (prajñāsubhāvita);he is in accordance with friendliness (maitrī);he is established in compassion (karuṇāpratiṣṭhita);he has realized through skillful means (upāyābhinirhṛta);he produces the supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) because he is endowed with such a dharma;he, having been elevated into the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by the supernormal knowledges, attains the mastery of all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya) by the supernormal knowledges;he, having seen all forms (sarvarūpadarśana), having heard all words (sarvaśabdaśravaṇa), and having entered into the whole thought (sarvacittapraveśa), recollects innumerable aeons (asaṃkhyeyakalpa);having obtained miracle (vikurvaṇa) which is the cessation of the sullied states (āsravakṣaya) through all his magical powers (sarvarddhi), he attains the mastery of all considerations (vyavacāra) with discrimination (vikalpa) as much as there is the discrimination of mind (manas);and thus, according to the all dharmas, he is established in non-effort (anābhoga).In that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva never turns back from his supernormal knowledges (acyutābhijñā) controls all dharmas (sarvadharmādhipatya).
22. DharmanayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva enter into the profound guiding principle of the dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) which is difficult for disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddha) to understand (prativedhya)?What is called ‘profound (gambhīra),’ son of good family, is the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda).The way of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanaya) is like this: formative factors are caused by ignorance; consciousness is caused by formative factors; name and form are caused by consciousness; the six fields of sense-perception is caused by name and form; touch is caused by the six fields of sense-perception; feeling is caused by touch; thirst is caused by feeling; grasping is caused by thirst; existence is caused by grasping; birth is caused by existence; ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression, and despair are caused by birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering originates. (yad uta avidyāpratyayā saṃskārāḥ saṃskārapratyayaṃ vijñānaṃ vijñānapratyayan nāmarūpan nāmarūpapratyayaṃ ṣaḍāyatanaṃ ṣaḍāyatanapratyaya sparśaḥ sparśapratyayā vedanā vedanāpratyayā tṛṣṇā tṛṣṇāpratyayam upādānam upādānapratyayobhavaḥ bhavapratyayā jātiḥ jātipratyayā jjarāmaraṇaśokaparidevaduḥkhadaurmanasyopāyāsāḥ saṃbhavaṃty evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya samudayo bhavati)What are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the vices (saṃkleśa) of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, this is called the guiding principle of the origin of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādasamudayanaya).What then is the guiding principle of the cessation of the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya)?To wit, cessation of formative factors is caused by cessation of ignorance comes; cessation of consciousness is caused by cessation of formative factors; cessation of name and form is caused by cessation of consciousness; cessation of the six fields of sense-perception is caused by cessation of name and form; cessation of touch is caused by cessation of the six fields of sense-perception; cessation of feeling is caused by cessation of touch; cessation of thirst is caused by cessation of feeling; cessation of grasping is caused by cessation of thirst; cessation of existence is caused by cessation of grasping; cessation of birth is caused by cessation of existence comes; cessation of ageing, death, sorrow, lamentation, suffering, depression and despair is caused by cessation of birth. Thus this great mass of utter suffering ceases. (yad uta avidyānirodhāt saṃskāranirodhaḥ, saṃskāranirodhād vijñānanirodhaḥ, vijñānanirodhānnāmarūpanirodhaḥ, nāmarūpanirodhāt ṣaḍāyatananirodhaḥ, ṣaḍāyatananirodhāt sparśanirodhaḥ, sparśanirodhād vedanānirodhaḥ, vedanānirodhāttṛṣṇānirodhaḥ, tṛṣṇānirodhādupādānanirodhaḥ, upādānanirodhād bhavanirodhaḥ, bhavanirodhājjātinirodhaḥ, jātinirodhājjarāmaraṇaśokaparidevaduḥkhadaurmanasyopāyāsā nirudhyante. evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati. evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati evam asya kevalasya mahato duḥkhaskandhasya nirodho bhavati)This, son of good family, is the guiding principle of dependent origination ceasing (pratītyasamutpādanirodhanaya).What are the causes and conditions (hetupratyaya) for the purification (vyavadāna) of living beings, in which the bodhisatva enters with knowledge, though any disciple or isolated buddha [cannot enter], this is called the entrance into the profound guiding principle of dharma.Why is that? Because both the vices of all living beings and the knowledge of purification (sarvasatvakleśavyavadānajñāna) belong to the sphere of the Awakened Lords (buddhagacara),and the bodhisatva understands these connetions (anusaṃdhi) by his own knowledge (ātmajñāna) and the presence of the Buddhas (buddhādhiṣṭhāna).Further, what we called ‘profound (gambhīra)’ is concerned with essential entities (satkāya).As the self is pure (ātmaviśuddhi), thus all dharmas are pure (sarvadharmaviśuddhi).Why? If you really search for essential entities (satkāya), they can never be grasped (nopalabhyante).That which can never be grasped is ‘profound (gambhīra).’The self has never been grasped by any buddha.Why is that?The self is originally pure (ādiviśuddha), and just as the self is pure, so all dharmas are pure.Why do we say ‘pure (viśuddha)’?Since any dharma is unoriginated (anutpanna) and beyond origination (anutpāda), not ceased (aniruddha), and beyond cessation (anirodha), it is called ‘pure (viśuddha).’In what is beyond darkness (andhakāra), beyond manifestation (anābhāsa), without basis (anālaya) and blindness (timira), in what is the deep and highest truth (gaṃbhīraparamārtha), there is no sight (cakṣur) or cessation of sight, up to and including no mind (manas) or cessation of mind, that is the space of objects (gocara) where there is no calculation (gaṇanā).That which makes the space of objects (gocara), being a space without objects, that is the highest truth (paramārtha), and that is why it is called ‘profound (gambhīra).’Because it cannot be grasped by thought and mind (acittamanogrāhya), it is difficult to understand (duradhigamya), difficult to see (durdṛśya), and difficult to comprehend (duḥprativedhya). But he, not dependent on others in respect of knowledge (jñānāparapraṇeya), still teaches this profound guiding principle of dharma to other living beings (parasatvān gambhīradharmanayaṃ pradeśayati),This is the entrance into the profound guiding principle of dharma (gambhīradharmanayapraveśa) of the bodhisatva, which is hard for disciples and isolated buddhas to fathom (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhaduravagāha).
23. Pratītyasamutpādagaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 3Son of good family, how does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala), and become free from two extreme views (sarvāntadvayadṛṣṭivivarjita)?.Son of good family, the bodhisatva should think like this (iha bodhisatvasyaivaṃ bhavati):that on which there is dependence, that is nothing in particular (yat pratītya tat kiṃcin nāsti);that on which there is dependence, that is inexistent (yat pratītya so ’bhāvaḥ);that on which there is dependence, that is not being established in reality (yat pratītya tad apariniṣpannam);that on which there is dependent origination, that is impermanence, suffering, selflessness and quiescence (yat pratītyasaṃutpannaṃ tad anityaduḥkhānātmaśāntam);in the dependent origination, there is no self, no being, no life-principle, no life-sustaining principle, no spirit, no personality, no human being, no man (na satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);in the dependent origination there is no attainment (samudgama);in the dependent origination there is nothing, and it is effortless (avyāyāma), empty (śūnya), no distinguishing mark (animitta), transcendent (viveka), no activity (apracāra), no discursive thinking (aprapañca), and thus beyond discursive thinking (niṣprapañca).Thus origination (jāti) is just the arising of the dharma, and cessation (nirodha) is also the ceasing of the dharma.Therefore it is said that there is no self, being, life-principle, life-sustaining principle, spirit, personality, human being, or man (satvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalamanujamānava);In the dharmas which are dependently originated there is no true origination (jāti) and there is no owner (svāmika).Because of that, all dharmas are like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsasadṛśa).Just as there is nothing that produces external things when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases external things when they cease, just so, there is nothing that produces internal things when they are originated, and there is nothing that ceases internal things when they cease;But rather, when conditions (pratyaya) exist they will arise, and when conditions are completely exhausted they will be destroyed.”If you understand this knowledge in that way, you will overcome any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).What then are extreme views (antadṛṣṭi)?‘Extreme (anta)’ means discontinuity (uccheda) and continuity (nitya), and that which is not originated and ceased is beyond discontinuity and continuity and thus pure, and therefore it is purified when concerned with any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).In that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva becomes skilled in knowing the entrance into the dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādapraveśajñanakuśala) and free from any extreme view (sarvāntadṛṣṭi).
24. TathāgatamudrāHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become skilled in knowing suchness without any differentiation (tathatāvinirbhāgajñānakuśala) as sealed with the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita)?With regard to what we called ‘being sealed with the seal of the tathāgata (tathāgatamudrāmudrita),’ suchness without any differentiation (tathatāvinirbhāga) is the seal, and it is without distinction, activity (apravṛtti), attachment (abhiniveśa), agitating, or being agitated, and thus it cannot be shaken (na kampayituṃ śakyate) by the world with its gods, humans, or anti-gods (sadevamānuṣāsureṇa lokena).Why? The world with its gods, humans and anti-gods is indeed sealed with that seal,and the seal of the tathāgata is the seal which is unoriginated, empty (śūnyatā), signless (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), free from desire (virāga), just as it is (tathatā), the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), and open space (gagana).Just as the seal in the empty space (gaganamudrā) does not appear, the seal of the tathāgata does not appear to even the five kinds of sight as it is sealed by the seal having its own essential character (svalakṣaṇamudrāmudrita).All the explanations about the dharma and the pertaining conventions (dharmavyavahāra) given by the tathāgata are sealed with the seal of the tathāgata in that way.Among them, those which pertain to the sphere of consciousness establish the dharma;but those which are not established in consciousness do not establish any dharma, and do not differentiate between any dharma;those which are sealed with the seal of the tathāgata do not differentiate suchness (tathatā).What then is the differentiation of suchness (nānātathatā)?It is those which differentiate (kalpayanti) the dharmas of superior, mediocre, and inferior (hīnamadhyaviśiṣṭa),those, which do not construct any dharma and do not make any differentiation, do not differentiate suchness,and, no matter how many things are imagined and constructed (kalpitavikalpita), they do not differentiate suchness.Just like all living beings wander about in empty space, the sphere of empty space (gaganadhātu) is not connected with them, in that way, all living beings wander about in suchness, but they do not tarnish suchness.And here, the bodhisatva who can understand such dharmas is sealed with the seal of the tathāgata, and he does not tarnish suchness.
25. DharmadhātuHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva relate to the guiding principle of the sphere of moments of existence (dharmadhātunaya), being united with (samavasarati) the sphere of all moments of existence (sarvadharmadhātu)?‘The sphere of moments of existence (dharmadhātu)’ is the sphere that is free from desire since it is free from any impurity (rāgavigatadhātuḥ sarvarajavigatatayā?);the sphere of non-origination (anutpanna) since it is not something in particular (asamudānīta);the sphere without cessation (anirodha) since there is no occurrence;the sphere that does not go anywhere (agamanatā) since there is no transmigration (gamana);the sphere without coming (anāgamanatā) since there is no passing over;the sphere without abiding since there is no arising;the sphere as it really is (yathāvaddharmadhātu) because of its sameness in all three times (tryadhvasamatā);the sphere of self (ātmadhātu) since it is originally pure (ādiviśuddhi);5the sphere without personality (niḥpudgaladhātu) since it is the highest truth (paramārtha);the sphere without information (avijñāptidhātu) since it is non-abiding;the sphere without basis (anālayadhātu) since there is no contamination (saṃkīrṇa);the sphere without birth (anutpādadhātu) since it is fixed (niyāma);the sphere like the space (gaganadhātu) since it is essentially tranquil (svabhāva_pariśuddhi);the sphere of liberation (nirvāṇadhātu) since there is no argument against it (apratipakṣa);such is the entrance into the way of the sphere of moments of existence (dharmadhātunayapreveśa).Since all moments of existence are like this, son of good family, if the bodhisatva enteres into the way of moments of existence, then, whatever he says, expresses, or teaches, all that is united with (samavasṛta) the sphere of moments of existence.Having entered into the way of the sphere of moments of existence, he knows the fact that there is no duality of the sphere of desire and the moments of existence (rāgadhātudharmadhātu)- why? - because the desire (rāga) has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of aversion (dveṣadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because aversion has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of delusion (mohadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? -because delusion has the nature of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of vices (kleśadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because vices has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of passion (kāmadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because passion has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because forms has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere without form (ārūpyadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the formlessness has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of the eye (cakṣurdhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the eye has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of forms (rūpadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because forms has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of eye-consciousness (cakṣurvijñānadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because eye-consciousness has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere in the interval of mind and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere of mind has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of mind-consciousness (manovijñānadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere of mind-consciousness has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of aggregates (skandhadhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the sphere of aggregates has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the sphere of earth, water, fire or wind (pṛthivīdhātvabdhātutejodhātuvāyudhātu) and the sphere of moments of existence - why? - because the earth, water, fire or wind has the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence;there is no duality of the eighty-four thousand masses of religious teaching (caturaśītidharmaskandhasahasranirdeśa), the eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour (caturaśītisahasracaritāna) or all moments of existence (sarvadharma) and the sphere of all moments of existence - why? - because all moments of existence have the nature of the sphere of all moments of existence.The bodhisatva knows all moments of existence since the moments of existence which is the entrance into the sameness (samatāpraveśa) is united with all moments of existence. Son of good family, this is the entering into the way of moments of existence of the bodhisatva.
26. DṛḍavajrāśayaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva with a resolve firm and unbrekable (dṛḍhābhedyāśaya) like the diamond (yathāvajra) become well established (susthita) and unwavering (aniñjya) in this great way?Son of good family, when the bodhisatva is unbreakable (abhedya) having made a resolve as firm as a diamond with the twelve qualities, he is not disturbed by the world with its gods (sadevakena lokena). What are those twelve (katamāni dvādaśa)?To wit, a) since the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), intention (āśaya), and determination (adhyāśaya) are unbreakable (abhedya), the practice (prayoga) is also unbreakable;b) the generosity (dāna) is unbreakable, and the morality, tolerance, vigour, meditation, and insight (dānaśīlakṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) are unbreakable;c) great friendliness (mahāmaitrī) and great compassion (mahākaruṇa) are unbreakable;d) the way of attraction (saṃgrahavastu) is unbreakable;e) bringing living beings to maturity (satvaparipācana) is unbreakable;f) the purification of the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetrapariśuddhi) is unbreakable;g) indefatigability in existence (saṃsārāparikheda) is unbreakable;f) non-satisfaction for the root of good (kuśalamūlātṛpti) is unbreakable;g) endless offerings (atyantayajña) for the sake of obtaining the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjana) are unbreakable;h) giving up body and life in order to uphold the true religion (saddharmaparigrahāya kāyajīvitaparityāgaḥ) is unbreakable;i) dedicating his roots of good (kuśalamūlapariṇāmana) for the sake of other beings (parasatvapudgala) is unbreakable;j) his accumulation of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmasamudānaya) is unbreakable.When the qualities of bodhisatva are unbreakable in that way, son of good family, he is unbreakable having made a resolve as firm as a diamond (dṛḍhavajrāśaya).Just as a diamond (maṇiratnavajra) breaks any kind of gem without being broken itself, so the bodhisatva, having made a resolve as firm as a diamond, removes bad habits, manifestations of vices, and wrong views (anuśayakleśaparyutthānadṛṣṭigata) of all living beings, but still he himself is not broken because of this great vehicle (mahāyāna).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva is unbreakable having made a resolves as firm as a diamond, being well established and unshakable in this great way.
27. BuddhaviṣayaHow then, son of good family, does the own realm (svaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva become pure, when he has attained the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)?‘The realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya)’ is not a realm, and since it is non-realm, it is purified of any realm.Thus the bodhisatva purifies his own sphere (svaviṣaya) by the purity of the sphere of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayapariśuddhi), and he thinks: “the realm of sight (cakṣurviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.”Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm (vivekaviṣaya), and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of sight.The realm of hearing (śrotraviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of hearing.The realm of smelling (ghrāṇaviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of smelling.The realm of tasting (jihvāviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of tasting.The realm of touching (kāyaviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of touching.The realm of mind (manoviṣaya) is the realm of the Buddha, and in the realm of the Buddha there is no nearness or farness.Why is that? This is because the realm of the Buddha is the transcendent realm, and the transcendent realm is beyond the realm of mind.It is the same case with the parts of personality, spheres, fields of sense perception, (skandhadhātvāyatana) and the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva enters into every realm as transcendent, and belonging to the realm of the Buddha.Entering into the field of the Buddha (buddhakṣetrapraveśa) by the purity of his own field (svakṣetrapariśuddhi) is the following: All the moments of existence appearing in his six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya), all those he enters as being transcendent as realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣayaviveka).Just as the realm of the Tathāgata (tathāgataviṣaya) is unattached and unobstructed, so there is no attachment or obstruction in all realms.In this way, son of good family, the bodhisatva, entering into the realm of the Buddha, purifies his own realm.
28. DhāraṇīHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva who has attained memory never forget (tatra katamā kulaputra bodhisatvasya dhāraṇīpratilabdhasya ’saṃpramoṣacaryā)?Son of good family, the bodhisatva attains memory (dhāraṇī) by purifying his memory (dhāraṇīpariśodhana).

BuddhakāryaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva appear to many beings (satveṣu pratyupasthitaḥ) performing the deeds of a Buddha (buddhakārya) even when the Buddhas do not appear?Son of good family, the bodhisatva has perfected the purification of the ten powers (daśabalapariśodhananiryāta) by knowing what is proper and what is improper (sthānāsthānajñāna);he has perfected the purification of the four fearlessness (caturvaiśāradyapariśodhananiryāta) by knowing the cessation of impurities (āsravakṣayajñāna);he has perfected the purification of the eighteen special qualities of the Tathāgata (aṣṭādaśāveṇikabuddhadharmapariśodhananiryāta) by knowing the unattached knowledge of the three times (tryadhvāsaṅgajñānajñāna);.he has perfected the purification of five kinds of sight (pañcacakṣuḥpariśodhananiryāta) by obtaining the light of the sight of the Buddha (buddhacakṣurālokalabdha);he has perfected the purification of all supernormal knowledges (sarvābhijñāpariśodhananiryāta) by the attainment of going to the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍagamanalabdha);he has perfected fulfilling all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharmaparipūraṇaniryāta) by completely cutting off the habitual patterns of vices (kleśavāsanā);he has perfected the purification of the ornaments of body, speech, thought, the auspicious marks and signs (kāyavākcittalakṣaṇānuvyañjanālaṃkārapariśodhananiryāta) by accumulating all collections of merits (sarvapuṇyasaṃbhāropacaya);he has perfected the purification of the ten stages (daśabhūmipariśodhananiryāta) by obtaining the stage of consecration (abhiṣeka);he has perfected the purification of all qualities of the Buddha (sarvabuddhadharmapariśodhananiryāta) by accumulating the collection of knowledges (jñānasaṃbhāropacaya);In that way, son of good family, the bodhisatva appears to many beings, performing the deeds of the Buddha even when the Buddhas do not appear.
34. SāgaramudrāsamādhiHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva become unattached to all thoughts and deeds of living beings (sarvasatvacittacaritāsakta) when he obtains the ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhipratilabdha)?.Son of good family, as many as features of living beings appear in the Jambudvipa World, the seal which is like all of them reflects in the great ocean, thus it is called the great ocean (māhasāgara).In the same way, as many as there are the appearance of thoughts (cittāvabhāsa), the appearance of forms (rūpāvabhāsa), or the appearance of sounds (śabdāvabhāsa), all those reflect in a single appearance (avabhāsa) of the bodhisatva who maintains the ocean seal samādhi, thus it is called the ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhi).Just as the great ocean is of a single taste (ekarasa), so the dharma of the bodhisatva is also of a single taste since he knows the taste of liberation (vimukirasa).Just as [the tide of] the great ocean is punctual, so the bodhisatva is never late for the seat of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa) by investigating when is the right time and wrong time.Just as the great ocean decomposes a rotting corpse (mahāsāgaro mṛtakuṇapena sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti), so the bodhisatva breaks down any habitual pattern of vices (sarvakleśavāsanā) or any thought of disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhacitta).Just as, no matter how much water in the great ocean is consumed, there is no increase or decrease, just so, no matter how much the dharma is consumed, the sphere of the dharma (dharmadhātu) of the bodhisatva is not increased or decreased.Just as the width of the great ocean is immeasurable, so the insight (prajñā) of the bodhisatva is immeasurable.Just as the depth of the great ocean is hard to fathom (duravagāha), so the profoundness of the bodhisatva is hard for disciples and isolated buddhas to understand.Just as the great ocean is the place of immeasurable living beings, so the maturing of immeasurable living beings (satvaparipācana) depends on the bodhisatva.This is the entrance of the ocean seal samādhi (sāgaramudrāsamādhipraveśa), and, son of good family, the bodhisatva who enters into the way is not attached to the thoughts or deeds of any living being (sarvasatvacittacaritāsakta).
35. SaṅgasamatikramaHow then, son of good family, does the bodhisatva transcend all attachments (sarvasaṅgasamatikrama)?What is called ‘attachment’ means the manifestation of viewpoints (dṛṣṭiparyutthāna) on the dharmas.The bodhisatva transcends all attachments since he is free from any manifestation of viewpoints (dṛṣṭiparyutthāna).Just as the wind (vāyu) is not attached to the vault of the sky, so the bodhisatva who is endowed with the wind-like thought is not attached to any living being.
36. ĀlokalabdhaThen, those good men know the way of good conduct (cāritra) and dignified manner (ācāra). Here, the dignified manner means mindfulness (smṛti) and the good conduct means non-distraction (avikṣepa).They obtain the light (āloka) being free from darkness (andhakāra). Here, what is called the darkness is the ignorance (ajñāna) of dharmas, and what is called the light is the unhindered knowledge (apratihatajñāna) of dharmas, thus those are called being free from darkness and obtaining the light.
37. SarvajñajñānaThose good men obtain the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), not being dependent on the knowledge of others (jñānāparapraṇeya)..Why is that? This is because they are dependent on the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), and do not seek the knowledge of other beings (parasatvajñāna).When the bodhisatva does not depend on others, obtains the self-originated knowledge (svayaṃbhujñāna), and teaches the knowledge of determining the dharma (dharmaviniścayajñānanirdeśa), then he immediately attains the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñāna).
Verses 87-118Then on that occasion the Lord uttered these verses (atha khalu bhagavāṃs tasyāṃ velāyāṃ imā gāthā abhāṣata):87 The wise one whose thought is detached from any viewpoint (dṛṣti), who accumulates merits (puṇya), who is without the appearance of distinguishing marks (nimittāvyutthāna), and who transforms everything into awakening, becomes imperishable.
88 Having abandoned pride and conceit (mānātimāna), seeking for the accumulation of knowledge (jñānasaṃbhāra), the wise one, having the nature of infinite space (anantagaganasvabhāva), fulfils the knowledge of omniscience (sarvajñajñānaṃ paripūrayati).
89 Son of the Victorious One (jinaputra), the recollection of the Buddha (buddhānusmṛti) is without the nature of form or essential character (rūpalakṣaṇadharmatā). Where there is no moving of thought or mind (cittamanas), there is the recollection of the Buddha.
90 The dharma which is free from desire (rāga), essentially transcendent, always peaceful and calm, the absence of distinguishing marks (animitta), and is free from any objective support (sarvālambana) is the recollection of the dharma (dharmānusmṛti).
91 The holy Saṃgha which is unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), empty (śūnyatā), without distinguishing marks (animitta), liberated from wishing (praṇidhāna) and in which there is no thinking nor any activity of recollection is the recollection of the Saṇgha (saṃghānusmṛti).
92 The renunciation which abandons all parts of personality (sarvaskandha), gives away any object of vices (sarvakleśavastu), purified from thought-constructions and discriminations (kalpavikalpa) without arrogance is the recollection of renunciation (tyāgānusmṛti).
93 The morality which is unsullied (anāsrava), unconditioned (asaṃskṛta), without any activity of body, speech or mind (kāyavākcitta), without any origination, and not dependent on the triple states of existence (tribhava) is the recollection of morality (śīlānusmṛti).
94 God is pure and free from impurity (mala) or vices (kleśa), dwells in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha), and obtains the stage of consecration (abhiṣeka). Recollecting such pure beings, one thinks “I will also become like him, the Lord, soon.”
95 Grasping the true dharma (saddharma) of the Tathāgata is not to grasp any object of vices (sarvekleśavastu) and to be liberated from both truth or untruth (dharmādharma), that is the grasping the true dharma of the Victorious One (Jina).
96 The Victorious One (jina) attains the essential character of awakening (bodhilakṣaṇa), and grasps the essential character of the dharma (dharmalakṣaṇa). That by which he knows the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi) without impurities is the obtaining all qualities of the Buddha (buddhadharma).
97 If you are pure yourself, living beings (satva) are also pure. The one who penetrates the wisdom that all dharmas are pure, his mind is basically pure (prakṛtiprabhāsvara), and he brings living beings to maturity in order for them to get rid of [the misunderstanding of an eternal] life principle (satva).
98 Not destroying (avināśayati) the sphere of living beings (satvadhātu), not seeing decreasing or increasing, teaching the abandonment of erroneous viewpoint, thus he purifies many beings (bahusatva).
99 He who teaches the sphere of this world, also teaches the sphere of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya); the sphere of the Buddha is just like open space (gagana), in this way he understands the sphere of this world.
100 When you see all sounds and syllables as an echo (pratiśrutkā), hearing disappears. This kind of insight (prajñā) is to obtain the memory (dhāraṇī).
101 While remembering, reciting, and explaining various teachings of the dharma, if you do not have any conception of self, living beings or even the dharma, then that is being established in memory (dhāraṇī).
102 Keeping the words of the Victorious One (jina), satisfying all living beings by eloquent speech (subhāṣita), never being separated from concentration (samādhi) with pure recollection, that is the qualities of the certainty of the memory (dhāraṇīniyāmaguṇa).
103 Not accumulating the dharma, not moving or wavering in the dharma, just as the nāgas bring down the incessant rain, so you should pour down the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa).
104 Eloquence (pratibhāna) which is the sources of good qualities (guṇākara) is without hindrance or interruption and is explaining thousand koṭis of sūtras (sūtrasahasrakoṭi) without discrimination of living beings by their abilities (satvendriya).
105 By the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), for the thousands koṭis of aeons, the dharma has been taught uninterruptedly. Living beings have been satisfied according to their wishes because the qualities of the Buddha have been established by the principle of eloquence (pratibhāna).
106 “All these dharmas are just as empty space,” knowing the aspects of all dharmas like this, he does not hold any concept of living beings, life principle, or person, this is to transcend the Māra inherent in the parts of personality (skandhamāra).
107 Since all living beings are originally extinguished (prakṛtinirvṛta), they are never born. His patience shining like this is not carelessness (apramāda) about this teaching.
108 Seeing all parts of personality (skandha) as an illusion (māyā), knowing all spheres as the sphere of the dharma (dharmadhātu), considering the six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya) as an empty town (śūnyagrāma), this is to transcend the Māra inherent in the parts of personality (skandhamāra).
109 Being aware of that vices (kleśa) are just like a mass of clouds (abhrakūṭa), examining the dharma correctly, and not making any thought-construction or fiction (akalpāvikalpa), this is to transcend the Māra inherent in vices (kleśamāra).
110 He who knows that there is no arising of birth, death, or transmigration, and there is no coming or going of the dharmas, he is not subject to the Māra of death (mṛtyumāra).
111 He who has no agitated or conceited thinking, who nurtures no idea of awakening (bodhisaṃjñā) even while abiding in awakening, and who practices compassion (karuṇā) even though he nurtures no idea of a self or living beings, he conquers the Māra and his forces (sabala).
112 Seeing both consciousness and knowledge (vijñānajñāna) equally, not being established in the conditioned nor the unconditioned, and regarding the thoughts of migrating beings (jagaccitta) as an illusion (māyā), that is the heroic uncrushability (anavamṛdya).
113 Not being attached to this side nor that side, sailing the vessel of the dharma (dharmanau), and liberating living beings without any idea of them, that is called the sameness of the bodhisatva.
114 He who knows that the three realms are just like a wilderness (kāntāra) which is void and unchangeable, but who still liberates living beings according to regular order (anupūrva), he is a caravan leader (sārthavāha) who guides the way to ambrosia (amṛta).
115 The learned who is skilled in the proper way and the improper way, who knows that the dharmas are empty from the very beginning, but who still leads [living beings] to liberation (nirvāṇa) by logical way, he is the bodhisatva called ‘a leader (nāyaka).’
116 He who knows that the train of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) always changes into somethings else, the [present] thought is not connected to the [past or future] thoughts, and thus the train of thoughts is migrating, he is the bodhisatva called ‘a principle (pariṇāyaka).’
117 Just as the nature of open space (gaganasvabhāva) or the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), all dharmas are pure and impeccable. Not being contaminated by any vice (kleśa), pure beings (pariśuddhasatva) are irreproachable (anindita).
118 He who, by a single dharma, knows that all dharmas are ungraspable, void, unreal, and impermanent just like an illusion or a mirage, he will soon reach the place of awakening.

VyākaraṇaWhen this decisive teaching was declared, seventy-two millions of gods, humans, asuras, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, and other beings produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening (iha dharmaniścaye nirdiśyamāne dvisaptatidevamānuṣāsurakinnaramahoragaprāṇiniyutānām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni);thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ pratilabdhā);this world system of three thousandfold worlds was shaken in its six ways (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātuś ca ṣaḍvikāraḥ prakampito abhūt);and the world was illuminated by a grand lustre (avabhāsa).A hundred thousand gods, having let fall the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) and played the celestial cymbals (tūrya), uttered a joyous utterance (udānam udānayati): “Living beings who, having heard this teaching, believe it, embrace it, practice it, and proceed to the realm of the Buddha (buddhaviṣaya).All the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra), where the Awakened Lords appear, are adorned with ornaments and respected by the wise.Why is that? When the Buddhas appear, such dharma will be taught, and the good men (satpurṣa) endowed with inconceivable qualities (acintyadharma) will see it.”Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja, having heard the Buddha’s prediction (vyākaraṇa), being delighted, offered to the body of the Buddha with a net of pearls (muktājāla) having an immaculate and pure radiance (vimalaviśuddhaprabha) with the value of pearls filling the three thousandfold world-system, and then he addressed himself to the Lord:“The knowledge of the Awakened Lords is free from any attachment or obstruction; his teaching is without interruption; and the Tathāgata sees the thoughts of all living beings and is skilled in knowing the superior or inferior abilities of them (indriyavarāvarajñāna).Since the Lord teaches such guiding principle of the dharma (dharmanaya), all congregations are satisfied,the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is praised,and the bodhisatvas, having been assembled from the worlds of ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu), were praised with this great light of the dharma.Since the Lord Tathāgata teaches the entrance into the dharma (dharmamukha) to us, based on the entrance into the source of the dharma, we will teach the immeasurable entrance into the dharma.
V. Miracle
PuṣpavarṣaGaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 4Then the bodhisatva, the great being named Āśupratibhāna joined this assembly, was seated with them, and said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (atha khalu āśupratibhāno nāma bodhisatvo mahāsatvo tatraiva pariṣadi sannipatito ’bhūt sanniṣaṇṇo gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvaṃ etad avocat):.“Son of good family, if your name is Gaganagañja, is this open space (gagana) your treasury (gañja)?”Gaganagañja said: “So it is, son of good family, the open space is my treasury (gagano mama gañjaḥ).”Āśupratibhāna said: “Son of good family, let us see the distinction of open space and treasury (gaganagañjaviśeṣa).Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvam mahāsatvam idam avocat):“Son of good family, let us see the distinction of open space and treasury.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna:“Whatever you want, son of good family, I will pour it down from open space as a rain.”Then the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish:“I have seen a lotus flower called ‘Sarvaprabhāvavairocana’ in the Padmavyūha universe of the Tathāgata Śrīratnotpala, that would be one krośa wide,consisting of hundred koṭis of young and tender petals,is pleasant to touch like soft cloth (kācilindika),has a fragrance (gandha) which filled the Buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra),and has many hundred thousand colors (varṇa).Thus when the bodhisatvas see the lotus flower, they are in rapture and unable to take their eyes off it.By seeing the lotus flower and by smelling its fragrance, the bodhisatvas attain concentration (samādhi).Please pour down the rain of such lotus flowers on us.”Immediately after the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna made a wish thus, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (gaganagañjādhiṣṭhāna), the rain of such lotus flowers began to pour down from the vault of the sky (gaganatala).Then, by smelling the lotus flowers, the whole assembly entered into the concentration called Prītyāhāra.Having emerged from the concentration, the whole assembly bowed to the bodhisatva Āśupratibhāna, and said:“The magical presence of the good man (satpurṣādhiṣṭhāna) and the power of insight (prajñābala) are good, these are good.May all living beings attain magical presence such as this (sarvasatvā īdṛśasya adhiṣṭhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”
RatnavarṣaThen the bodhisatva Ratnavyūha joined this assembly (atha khalu ratnavyūho nāma bodhisatvo sannipatito ’bhūt), was seated with them, and said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Please, son of good family, pour down a rain of gold dust.”Immediately after the bodhisatva Ratnavyūha said thus, the rain of gold dust poured down from the sky.Then the bodhisatva Ratnavyūha said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, please pour down rain of all kinds of jewels from the sky.”Immediately after his words, the great rain of immeasurable, incalculable amount of jewels, equal to Mount Sumeru in size, with various kinds of names and colors, poured down from ten directions.To wit, gold (suvarṇa), silver (rajata), crystal (sphaṭika), lapis lazuli (vaiḍūrya), emerald (aśmagarbha), ruby (lohitamuktikā), white coral (musāragalva), Śrīgarbha gem, stainless jewel, red coral gem, moonstone (candraprabhā), sunstone (sūryakānta), illuminating gem, brightening gem, Jambū-light gem, fire-light gem, conch shell (śaṅkha), crystal (śilā), red coral (pravāla), sapphire (indranīla), Guṇākara gem, calm light gem, water-light gem, water-like gem, transparent gem, earthy light gem, indestructible gem, blinding gem, śakra-holding gem, victor’s gem, the great victor’s gem, blazing light gem, the victor’s essence of glory gem, adamantine gem, worldly light gem, Jyotīrasa gem, shining gem, Ardhacandra gem, Jambū-water-light gem, Jambūdvīpa-light gem, thousand lights gem, shooting star gem, burning light gem, … and nameless gems; the rain of these jewels poured down, and it was not easy to enumerate all the names of precious jewels even for an aeon.
ĀhāracīvaravarṣaThen the bodhisatva named Kālarāja addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“In this Saha universe (sahālokadhātu), son of good family, there are living beings suffering from poverty (daridra), lacking food or drink (anannapāna), and wearing ragged clothes; there are hungry ghosts (preta) tormented by hunger and thirst (kṣutpipāsā), covering themselves with their hairs, and subsisting on such as spittle, mucus, blood, and pus (kheṭasiṃhāṇarudhirapūya). In order to protect these living beings, please pour down the rain of food, drink, and clothing!”Immediately after that, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the rain of all kinds of delicious hard foods, soft foods (khādanīyabhojanīya), and soups poured down;the rain of all kinds of tasty beverages poured down to the depth of a chariot’s axle (akṣamātrābhir dhārābhiḥ);the rain of many hundred thousand colors of clothes, which are pleasant to touch like the thin and soft cloth (kācilindika), poured down.Then, in this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu), all the wretched and poor (sarvakṛpaṇadaridra), and all hungry ghosts (sarvapreta) were satisfied.
AmṛtavarṣaThen the bodhisatva Vaidyarāja addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, there are patients (vyādhita) suffering from many diseases without nurse. For the sake of them, please pour down the rain of great medicine by which all the sick get free from sickness!”Immediately after that, the rain of ambrosia (amṛtavarṣa) poured down from the open space (āntarīkṣa), and all the sick were free from all diseases.
PāramitāvarṣaThen the bodhisatva Apāyajaha addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, please pacify three evil existences (tryapāya).”Immediately after that, a bright light shone from the open space (āntarīkṣa), and the inhabitants of hell (naraka), animals (tairyagyonika), and the inhabitants of Yāma’s world (yamalaukika), all those who were touched by the light were filled with happiness (sukha), and so all beings in the three evil existences were pacified.Then, the rain of gifts, such as flowers (puṣpa), garlands (mālā), incenses (gandha), unguents (upalepana), aromatic powers (cūrṇa), religious robes (cīvara), parasols (chattra), banners (dhvaja), pennons (patākā), five kinds of musical instruments (vādita), songs, male servants (dāsa), female servants (dāsī), wives (bhāryā), boys (dāraka), girls (kanyā), female attendants (dāra), horses (aśva), elephants (hasti), chariots (ratha), foot-soldiers (patti), vehicles (vāha), houses (gṛha), villages (sagrāma), cities (nagara), towns (nigama), provinces (janapada), kingdoms (rāṣṭra), capitals (rājadhāni), gardens (udyāna), pavilions (kūṭāgāra), palaces (prāsāda), portals (toraṇa), windows (gavākṣa), half-moon shaped decorations on building (ardhacandra), thrones (mañca), palanquin (śivika), and chariots drawn by four cattle, sixteen cattle, and a thousand of good horses (aśvājāneya), poured down from the open space.Thus the bodhisatva Gaganagañja sustained by the magical presence said to the whole congregation of bodhisatvas:“Sons of good family, having received all these riches, give them all away, and fulfill the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā)!”Then the bodhisatva named Śīlālaṃkāra said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Son of good family, if the rain of the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā) poured down by your magical power, why do you not pour down the rain of the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā)?”Immediately after his words, the buddhas and bodhisatvas in ten directions praised the adornments of the virtues of morality (śīlaguṇālaṃkāra), and the voice of praising the virtues of morality, as many expressions as there are, resonated in the open space (āntarīkṣa).In the same way, the voices of [praising] the virtues of tolerance, vigour, meditation, and insight (kṣāntivīryadhyānaprajñā) [resonated in the open space.] As long as the buddhas and bodhisatvas in ten directions taught a hundred thousand ways into the dharma (dharmamukha) by means of syllables, explanations, and agreed terms (akṣaraniruktisaṃketa), all those voices of the dharma, which never increase or decrease and do not enter into any difference, resonated in the open space endlessly.By the sound of the dharma, all living beings in this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu) obtained this understanding,and thus immeasurable and incalculable living beings became matured in the three vehicles (triyāna).
Dharmavarṣa no dharnavarṣa sectionThen the bodhisatva named Samantāloka thought like this:Does this magical arrangement (vyūha) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja exist only in this world, or in other world-spheres as well?The bodhisatva Gaganagañja, knowing telepathically the thought of the bodhisatva Samatāloka, said to him (atha gaganagañjo bodhisatvo bodhisatvasya samatālokasya cetasā cetaḥparivitarkam ājñāya bodhisatvaṃ samatālokam etad avocat):“Son of good family, if you gain the divine sight (divyacakṣur) which is completely clear and pure, son of good family, you can look at whatever can be seen in the world-spheres of ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu).”Then when the bodhisatva Samantāloka examined the world-spheres of ten directions by the divine sight, in immeasurable and incalculable Buddha-fields of the ten directions, just as the rain of all kinds of jewels poured down and all voices of the dharma resounded in this Sahā universe, just so in those Buddha-fields he saw that such phenomena occurred without increasing or decreasing, and without entering into any difference.Then the bodhisatva Samantāloka, having been astonished (āścaryaprāpta), uttered a joyous utterance (udānam udānayati): “The accomplishment of the magical presence (adhiṣṭhāna) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s vow (praṇidhāna) is inconceivable (acintya).O Good man (satpuruṣa), please pure down a rain like this on all the buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) immediately.”Then, by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva) and the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the whole assembly saw the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) and the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa) pouring down on those buddha-fields.By this miracle (prātihārya), the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) and the rain of the dharma (dharmavarṣa), performed by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, immeasurable beings (gaṇanāsamatikrāntasatva) produced the thought of awakening (samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni).
NirmitapuruṣaThen five hundred widows, having departed from the city of Rājagṛha and proceeded to the place where the bodhisatva Gaganagañja stayed, said this to him:“If you fulfill the wishes of all living beings, O Good man (satpuruṣa), please return our husbands.”Immediately after that, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, five hundred men resembling their deceased husbands in colors, distinguishing marks, and appearances (varṇanimittasaṃsthāna), having descended from the open space (gaganād avatīrya), settled down in front of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the women:“Sisters (bhaginī), bring your respective husbands just as they were (yathābhūta).”Then the women, having brought their respective husbands, being filled with rejoicing and happiness of mind, returned to their respective homes.After that, by those magically created beings (nirmitāḥ puruṣāḥ), during seven days (saptāha), the women were brought to maturity, in the way that they attained the stage of not falling back (avaivartika) from the supreme and perfect awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).Then the five hundred widows, having come to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, uttered these verses:
119 The nature of the dharma (dharmasvabhāva) is empty (śūnya), just as an illusion (māyā), and we did not know the essence of the dharma (dharmalakṣaṇa) before. But you gave magically created husbands to us, thereby we were matured in the highest vehicle (agrayāna).120 Since all these dharmas are magically created, they are already empty, without movement or activity. By fully understanding the uncontaminated knowledge (anāsravajñāna), from this time forth, we will never get into the power of vices (kleśavaśa).121 We will produce the thought of the highest awakening (agrabodhicitta), and take care of all living beings. Just as you poured down the magnificent on living beings, we will pour down the rain of the highest dharma (agradharmavarṣa).122 The Sage (muni), the highest leader (agranāyaka), predicted for them: “In the future, when you completed your practice, you will become supreme conquerors (jinendra), the well-gone ones (sugata) called Suvinīta.”
AbhayadānaAt that time, there were five hundred men who were in danger of being killed [by robbers.] When they were led to their death, a voice resonated in open space: “You should do homage to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, who provides fearlessness (abhaya) to the frightened, then you will be saved from death.”Then all those, terrified with the fear of death, said together in one voice: “Homage to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (namo gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya)!”In that very moment, five hundred men, having descended from the open space and arrived at that place, said this to robbers (vadhakapuruṣa):“Why do you kill these poor men? Kill us, take our clothes and ornaments, and set them free.”Then the robbers released the five hundred men to be killed because of vices caused by their greed, and killed the magically created men.Then they, freed from the robbers, found their relief (āśvāsana) from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭa) of being killed, went to the place where the bodhisatva Gaganagañja stayed, bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, joined the palms of their hands (añjali), bowed to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and said:“We survived and found relief because of you, O Good man (satpuruṣa), please teach us the dharma which is the entrance into development for myself and others, because one can make progress in the dharma.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Sons of good family, you should conceive the incomparable complete awakening (utpādayata idānīm anuttarāyāṃ samyakṣaṃbodhau cittam), in this way, you can practice what is benefit for yourselves and for others (ātmahitaparahita).”Thus addressed, they generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi), and offered a hundred thousand calico clothes (duṣya) to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.Then, saying “Friends, let us also offer this calico clothes to the Lord,” all those offered calico clothes for the body of the Lord.Thereupon the Lord prophesied: “After incalculable aeons, when you achieved the way of the dharma which are wings of awakening (sarvabodhipakṣikadharmanaya), all of you will appear in this world as the tathāgatas called Abhayadāna.”
VI. Dialogues
----------
Śāriputra
Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (atha khalu āyuṣmañ śāriputro gaganagañjaṃ bodhisatvam etad avocat): “After you established this treasury in the inexhaustible, imperishable, and permanent open space, son of good family, how long will it be continued?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Śāriputra, do you think the open space will be exhausted and destroyed, then disappear?”Śāriputra replied: “No indeed, son of good family.”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Śāriputra, in the same way awakening has the essential character of open space (tathā śāriputra bodhir gaganasvabhāvalakṣaṇā), and, in the case, my roots of good are transformed into that. This is the reason why this treasury of open space (gaganagañja) is inexhaustible, imperishable, and permanent.Again, as for your question regarding how long this treasury will be continued after having been established in open space, it will be continued as long as the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), generated by me, will be continued.Śāriputra asked: “Son of good family, how long will the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) be continued after having been generated by you?”Gaganagañja answered: “It is known by the knowledge of the Tathāgata (tathāgatajñāna).”The Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu sthaviraḥ śāriputrao bhagavantam etad avocat): “O Lord, how long the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) will be continued after the bodhisatva Gaganagañja produced it?”The Lord said: “If the Tathāgata teaches this subject (sthāna), all of the world including the gods (sadevaloka) will be confused (pramatta).Śāriputra said: “O Lord, there are many living beings in this assembly who are very thoughtful (pratyavekṣaṇābahula) and faithful, so please teach us.”The Lord said: “It is like this, Śāriputra, as if the world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā (gaṅgānadīvālukopama) are filled with the atomic-sized dust of buddha-fields as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, as if all the atomic-sized dust (paramāṇurajas) is put into a single dust grain of a field during many hundreds of thousands of aeons, in the same way of calculating and establishing distinguishing marks (gaṇanānimittapratiṣṭhāpana), even though all the dust would be exhausted, the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi), which was produced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, for the uncountable hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of ages (asaṃkhyeyakalpakoṭīniyutaśatasahasra), would never be exhausted (parikṣi-).”Śāriputra said: “O Lord, What is the name of the tathāgata when the thought of awakening was produced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja for the first time?”The Lord said: “At the time, Śāriputra, the tathāgata Sarvapraṇidhānaratnatejobhyugatāryarāja, worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one, perfect in wisdom and conduct, a sugata, a knower of the world, a charioteer of human beings to be tamed, unsurpassable, a teacher of gods and men, a buddha, a blessed one appeared in the aeon called Ratnavyūha, in the universe called Sarvabuddhakṣetradarśana (tena ca śāriputra kālena tena samayena sarvapraṇidhānaratnatejobhyugatāryarājo nāma tathāgato ’rhan samyakṣaṃbuddho vidyācaraṇasaṃpannaḥ sugato lokavid anuttaraḥ puruṣadamyasārathiḥ śāstā devamanuṣyāṇāṃ buddho bhagavān sarvabuddhakṣetradarśane lokadhātu ratnavyūhe kalpe).Again, Śāriputra, it is not easy to express the splendor of the virtues of that tathāgata’s buddha-field (buddhakṣetraguṇavyūha), remaining here with a life-span of a world-age (kalpāyuṣpramāṇasthityā).Śāriputra, the whole retinue (parṣanmaṇḍala) of that tathāgata reached to thousands of world-sphere, and the congregation of the bodhisatvas (bodhisatvasaṃgha) was incalculable.And, Śāriputra, a universal king (cakravartirāja) called Sarvadevābhiṣeka appeared in three-thousandfold universe (trisāhasra), who had a inconceivable treasury of jewels (acintyaratnagañja).He had ninety six thousand sons who were spontaneously generated (upapāduka) by his own majesty (svatejas).Why is that? Because there has been not even the concept of woman in that buddha-field.Śāriputra, that tathāgata lived for one hundred thousand aeons.At that time, the king Sarvadevābhiṣeka had paid homage and respect to the Lord for forty internal aeons (antarakalpa), making offerings of a heap of jewels (ratnarāśi), as much as Mount Sumeru, every single day.By the firmness of his merits (puṇya), the king, his sons, his village’s people and retinues generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).Śāriputra, [if you think that,] at that time, the universal king Sarvadevābhiṣeka was a someone else, you should not think so (na khalu punar evaṃ draṣṭavyam).Why is that? It is the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, who, during that period of time, was the Sarvadevābhiṣeka, the universal king of the three-thousandfold universe (tat kasmād dhetoḥ | gaganagañjaḥ sa bodhisatvo tena kālena samayena sarvadevābhiṣeko nāma rājābhūc cakravartī trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātau).”Then the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣmañ śāriputro bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, being clad in the inconceivable armour (acintyaṃ saṃnāhaṃ saṃnaddhaḥ), has ridden in the great vehicle (mahāyāna) during that time.Lord, by such behaviour and such dharma, he was able to obtain the great power (mahānubhāva).”The Lord said: “Since this bodhisatva Gaganagañja paid homage and respect to the Awakened Lords as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā (gaṅgānadīvālikāsama), Śāriputra, his thought of awakening (bodhicitta) was purified;by purifying his thought of awakening as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his intention (āśaya) was purified;by purifying his intention as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his practice (prayoga) was purified;by purifying his practice as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, his determination (adhyāśaya) was purified;by purifying his determination as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of generosity as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of morality as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of endurance (kṣāntipāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of endurance as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of vigour as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of meditation as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of insight as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the perfection of skillful means (upāyapāramitā) was purified;by purifying the perfection of insight as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, the unhindered thoughts and unobstructed rays of light to all beings (sarvasatvāpratihatacittāpratihataraśmi) were purified;by purifying unhindered thoughts and unobstructed rays of light to all beings as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, great friendliness (mahāmaitrī) was purified, thereby great compassion (mahākaruṇā), great delight (mahāmuditā), great equanimity (mahopekṣā), and the knowledge of the great supernormal knowledges (mahābhijñājñāna) were purified;in the same way, his bodily action, speech, and thought (kāyavākcitta) were purified, then by purifying his thoughts as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, one characteristic of a great man (mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa) was purified;and so on, up to: having purified all the thirty-two marks of a great man (sarvadvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa), his roots of good (kuśalamūla) was purified; by purifying his roots of good as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, this bodhisatva Gaganagañja was purified in order to purify this treasury of open space (gaganagañjapariśodhana).Śāriputra, this bodhisatva Gaganagañja demonstrated all those practices of the bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryā) in the open space. And, Śāriputra, just as the open space is imperishable, just so, by purifying all vows and practices (praṇidhānacaryā) of this son of good family, all of them are also imperishable. Therefore it is called ‘the treasury of open space (gaganagañja).’”When this teaching was declared (iha nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne), a thousand bodhisatvas (bodhisatvasahasra), holding jewels of inexhaustible wealth in their hands (akṣayabhogaratnapāṇi), produced the tolerance of fulfilling the vows of the treasury of open space.
Dharmarāja
Then, the bodhisatva, Dharmarāja by name, addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, let me listen to the treasury of hearing the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa) from open space.”Gaganagañja said: “If you conceive the concept of this open space as your teacher (śāstṛsaṃjñā), with respect and reverence (sagauravasapratīśa), son of good family, then you will listen to the treasury of hearing the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).”The bodhisatva Dharmarāja and the whole congregation, having joined the palms of their hands, paid homage to open space, and sat down.Then, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (gaganagañjādhiṣṭhāna), these verses resonated in open space:
123 There is a principle that minds and all dharmas are just like open space. Listen to my instruction of entering into the [principle,] step by step (krameṇa).124 Just as there is no high or low in open space, so there is no superior or inferior in the nature of the dharma (dharmatā), then how could we pay respect something else [except for open space]?125 Just as there is not any origination nor cessation perceived in open space, so there is no thought-construction (vikalpa) in all dharmas which are unborn.126 Just as there is no decreasing or increasing perceived in open space, so all dharmas do not increase or decrease.127 Just as there is no darkness or defilement, the nature of mind (cittaprakṛti) is luminous, thus it is undefiled.128 Just as open space is not delighted even by the sunlight or moonlight, our thoughts are also not agitated by anything.129 Just as open space is not damaged in the hail of spears and arrows, so the Son of the Victorious One (jinaputra) is not afflicted by any suffering coming from all directions.130 Just as the open space is not delighted by the rain of ambrosia (amṛtavarṣa), the bodhisatva is not pleased with any gain or honour (lābhasatkāra).131 Just as the open space never makes discriminative construction on praise or blame, so the bodhisatva is stable and unwavering in pleasure and suffering (sukhaduḥka).132 Just as the open space is never shaken while the whole ground is shaking, just so the bodhisatva is never agitated while this world is shaking.133 Just as the open space is not burnt even when the fire breaks out at the end of the aeon (kalpoddāha), so the bodhisatva is stable and is not burnt by any vice (kleśa).134 Just as the open space remains without birth or death, so all dharmas remains in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu) without going or coming.135 Just as all manifestations of forms (rūpāvabhāsa) appear in open space, so all manifestations of dharmas (dharmāvabhāsa) appear in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu).136 Due to the absence of distinguishing marks and form, the open space cannot be seen. When you understand the nature of thoughts in this way, it will be like the open space.137 The open space is only a name (nāmamātra), without color and form (varṇasaṃsthāna), in the same way, thought, mind, and consciousness (cittamanovijñāna) are illustrated (paridīpita) by name.138 Just as the open space is boundless and ungraspable (agrāhya) everywhere, the great power of insight (prajñāmahānubhāva) is the same as the sameness of open space (gaganasamasadṛśa).139 Just as a bird flying in the sky does not leave any trace, one who practices for awakening does not have any distinguishing mark (nimitta) in their behaviour.140 Just as, the body is originally the same as open space, so the essential nature of the parts of personality (skandhasvabhāva) is the same as open space.141 It is said that the four elements (caturdhātu) are the same as open space, in the same way, even in the fire at the end of the aeon (kalpoddāha), these elements are still same as the open space.142 Just as the open space cannot be filled up with even all beings, so the series of thoughts (cittasaṃtāna) also cannot be filled up with all objects of sense (sarvaviṣaya).143 The great words with the lion’s roar (siṃhanāda), the words given by the protector of the world (lokanātha), and the supermundane insight (lokottaraprajñā), you should find satisfaction in these teachings.144 Just as the end of the open space cannot be perceived because it is too extensive (vipula), just so the teachings of the buddha also cannot be attained.145 All dharmas are the buddha. He who knows this truth will not destroy existence nor remain in existence.146 The wise, discerning existence and non-existence (bhāvābhāva), remain in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), but never take the view of existence or non-existence.147 Even though emptiness (śūnyatā) is proclaimed by sound (śabda), but emptiness is not in the sound. It is beyond sound and inexpressible, thus it is called ‘emptiness.’148 Even though all buddhas teach emptiness (śūnyatā), it is inexpressible. That is called emptiness, thus its meaning (artha) is also inexpressible.149 By using metaphors such as illusion, mirage, dream, reflection, echo, etc. (māyāmarīcisvapnapratibhāsapratiśrutkādi), the leaders (nāyaka) teach the dharma.150 In order to lead many beings, metaphors are taught. In this peaceful dharmas, there is no obstacle (pratipakṣa) perceived.151 Even though all dharmas are without essential character (alakṣaṇa), it is taught by its essential character. Something characterized or something not characterized (lakṣyālakṣya), anything does not exist in the the absolute reality (dharmadhātu).152 What to be characterized (lakṣya) has the character of open space (gaganalakṣaṇa), and the character of open space is not found. Those who fully understand this principle are the bodhisatvas.153 He, who is not attached nor bound even to the smallest thing, who is without activity (aprapañca), and who is free from discursive thinking (niḥprapañca), is called the bodhisatva.154 He who is not separated from living beings, who remains among living beings, and who understand the nature of living beings (satvasvabhāva) is called the bodhisatva.155 Having heard that living beings are originally extinguished, not being afraid of that, such is the armor (saṃnāha) of heroes, the entrance of awakening.156 Even if a magician, after having created many creatures, killed them all, there was no killing; the essential character of living beings is exactly like that.157 The natures of illusion, living beings, extinction, and the buddha (māyāsatvanirvāṇabuddha) have one essence, and he understands the own nature is the absence of the nature.158 The bodhisatva Gaganagañja has attained the imperishable treasury (akṣayagañja) from the open space, thus this treasury will not be exhausted, even while satisfying all living beings.159 Since the stream (nadī) of immeasurable merits (puṇya) purifies this treasury, in the imperishability of all dharmas, you should see the true state of all dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā).160 If you understand that all dharmas have arisen from causes, their treasury will be inexhaustible, and the treasury of the dharma (dharmagañja) will be inconceivable.161 The protector of the world (lokanātha) has taught the inexhaustibility (akṣayatā) of these four dharmas, to wit, living beings (satva), open space (gagana), the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), and the dharma of the Buddha (buddhadharma).162 If those were material things, those will be exhausted; but since those are not material things, those are inexhaustible, thus it is called ‘inexhaustible.’163 Since the dharma is momentary, even if the dharma is consumed, it would never be exhausted. There is nothing exhausted in that inexhaustibility, thus it is called ‘inexhaustibility (akṣayatā).’164 The bodhisatva, who understands this teaching of the dharma (dharmadeśanā), will attain awakening without any difficulty and enter into awakening.
When this versified teaching was taught, one hundred thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti),and twelve thousand sons of gods (devaputra) dwelling in the vault of the open space (gaganatala) generated the thought of incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).
Kutūhalajāta
At that time, the bodhisatva, the great being Kutūhalajāta came and sat down in this assembly, addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, thinking about where this sound [of the dharma (dharmaśabda)] is coming from (niścar-), I am absolutely astonished (āścaryaprāpta).”The Lord said: “Son of good family, you should ask the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, and he will answer to you.”The bodhisatva Kutūhalajāta said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I am absolutely astonished (kutūhalajāta), thinking about where this sound [of the dharma (dharmaśabda)] is coming from.”Gaganagañja said: “What do you think, son of good family (tat kiṃ manyase kulaputra)? Where is an echo (pratiśrutkā)coming from?”Kutūhalajāta said: “Son of good family, the sound of an echo comes from the sound uttered by another person (paraśabdavijñapti).”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, does an echo (pratiśrutkā) have body, thought, form, color, or shape (kāyacittarūpavarṇasaṃsthāna)?Kutūhalajāta said: “No, son of good family.”Gaganagañja said: “Quite so, son of good family. Just as an echo does not really exist (apariniṣpanna) and it is merely the perception of sounds (śabdasaṃprāpaṇa), in the same way, [the sound of the dharma coming from] open space does not really exist and it is also the perception of sounds.”Kutūhalajāta said: “Son of good family, who perceives this sound? where is this sound coming from?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, the recognition of knowledge (jñānaprativijñapti) is incomprehensible. Even though we think that it is coming from this open space because of the reflection of our mind, it is neither going nor coming. The resonance of sound is just coming.Son of good family, you should examine its profoundness (gaṃbhīra) in the perspective of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda).Even though the result arises from the causes, the causes is not transferred to the attainment of fruits (phalodaya), but when there is no cause, there is no arising of result.That is to say, this dharma is produced as a result (phala) from causes and conditions (hetupratyaya), but even so there is no activity (āniṃjya) nor agent (kāraka) in them.Those who perceive things thus are beyond the fruition of causes (visāmagrī).Why is that? This is because the Lord said that understanding defilements (saṃkleśa) is purification (vyavadāna); suppressing defilements (saṃkleśasaṃghāta) is not purification as the essential character (svabhāvalakṣaṇa) of defilement is purification.In fact, both defilement and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are just conventional expressions (saṃketapada).Defilement and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna) are not apprehended within the limit of the ultimate truth (paramārthakoṭi).Since the limit of the ultimate truth is beyond limit (akoṭi), that which is beyond limit is the true limit (bhūtakoṭi).The true limit (bhūtakoṭi) is the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi).The the limit of emptiness (śūnyatākoṭi) is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi).The limit of the self is the limit of all dharmas (sarvadharmakoṭi).Why is that? Concerning all dharmas, the limit of them, the limit of emptiness, and the limit of tranquility; being unattached to the gate into these three limits is attaining the unattached knowledge to any dharma.Then Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the bodhisatva Kutūhalajāta: “Son of good family, why are you called Kutūhalajāta?”Kutūhalajāta said: “Venerable Śāriputra, wherever you have wished and struggled for the dharma, have you wondered about it?”Śāriputra said: “Quite so, son of good family.”Kutūhalajāta said: “In the same way, Venerable Śāriputra, I have wished and struggled for all dharmas here and there, but I still wonder about when I can fulfill all the qualities of the buddha. That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.I wonder about all practices of the bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryā) and the knowledge of entering into the thoughts and deeds of all living beings (sarvasatvacittacaritāpraveśajñāna). That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.What I wonder about is without any knowledge or any entrance. That is way I called Kutūhalajāta.That on which I wonder about is without weak point (avatāra) concerning any vice (sarvakleśa) or any work of Māra (sarvamārakarma). That is why I am called Kutūhalajāta.”Then the Śāriputra the Elder addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, even though this name of good person proclaims and teaches all dharmas of the buddha, he is not attached to any dharma of the buddha. It is a wonderful to teach all dharmas of the buddha without any attachment.”
Ratnaśrī
Then the bodhisatva, Ratnaśrī by name, came and sat down in this assembly, said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“With reference to the teaching of concentration (samādhiprakāśanam ārabhya), son of good family, may you elucidate (pratibhātu) what kind of concentration should be purified (samādhipariśodhana).Thus addressed (evam ukte), the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī:

Son of good family, there are eighty1 ways into those concentrations (samādhimukha), and again each of them has five hundred gates into concentrations;adding all of them together, those will be forty thousand concentrations, and thus those will be eighty thousand concentrations counting impurity and purification (saṃkleśavyavadāna);those will be eighty-four thousand concentrations of knowing the imperishability (akṣayatā) in the past, future, and present.As many as are concentrations, so many are ways into the dharma (dharmamukha), and so many are masses of religious teachings (dharmaskandha). Thus it is said that the Tathāgata explained eighty-four thousand masses of religious teachings (caturaśītidharmaskandhasahasra) for the sake of entering into the eighty-four thousand kinds of behaviour of living beings.This is, son of good family, the summary of the dharma (dharmoddāna) for all beings to know the entrance into the knowledge and practices of the buddha (buddhajñānapracārapraveśa).Since that which is entering into all knowledge of the buddha and all behaviour of living beings is immeasurable and inconceivable, even if your life were to last eight thousand aeons, it would not be easy to express.When this knowledge of the buddha was taught and those gates into concentrations were explained, sixteen thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti), which is brought about through the knowledge and concentrations (samādhijñānābhinirhṛta).Eighty-four thousand sons of gods produced the thought of incomparable complete awakening (caturaśītisahasradevaputrā anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpādayanti).Then the Lord applauded the bodhisatva Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya sādhukāram adāt):“Good man (satpuruṣa), the teaching of this gate into concentration (samādhimukha) was well spoken (subhāṣita) by you. Just as the dharmas are not dependent on others (aparapratyaya) because they are directly perceived by [the senses] of your body (kāyapratyakṣa), in the same way the knowledge of the tathāgata was elucidated - this complete teaching is good, very good.”
gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 5Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, how did the bodhisatva Gaganagañja pour down the rain of all kinds of jewels (sarvaratnavarṣa) for the first time?”At these words, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī (evam ukte bhagavān ratnaśrīṃ bodhisatvam etad avocat):“Once, son of good family, long ago, countless aeons ago, long and very long before, at that time, the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja, worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one, perfect in wisdom and conduct, a sugata, a knower of the world, a charioteer of human beings to be tamed, unsurpassable, a teacher of gods and men, a buddha, a blessed one appeared in the aeon called Guṇaprabha, in the universe called Kāyabandhana (tena kālena tena samayena vimalaprabhānantaraśmirājo nāma tathāgato ’rhan samyakṣaṃbuddho vidyācaraṇasaṃpannaḥ sugato lokavid anuttaraḥ puruṣadamyasārathiḥ śāstā devamanuṣyāṇāṃ buddho bhagavān kāyabandhane lokadhātau guṇaprabhe kalpe).That universe called Kāyabandhana was, son of good family, thriving, prosperous, safe, well-provided, filled with a great multitude of men (ṛddhaś ca sphītaś ca kṣemaś ca subhikṣaś cākīrṇabahujanamanuṣyaś ca), adorned with seven precious jewels (saptaratnālaṃkṛta), peaceful and delightful, pleasant to touch like a soft cloth (kācilindika), displayed by the lotus of gold from the Jāmbū river (jāmbūnadapadma), decorated with all kinds of luminous jewels, patterned like a chess-board (aṣṭāpadanibaddha), and even like the palm of the hand (samapāṇitalajāta).Just like the enjoyment (bhoga) and entertainment (samudācāra) of the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods, all the people in that universe, staying in celestial palace (vimāna) and pavilions (kūṭāgāra), enjoyed food and drink (anannapāna) as they wished.Son of good family, there were the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja and sixty hundred billion bodhisatvas in his great congregation of bodhisatvas.Then at that time, son of good family, there was a universal king (cakravartirāja) called Puṇyālaṃkāra who possessed seven precious jewels (saptaratnasamanvāgata).His palace was built in the center of Jambūdvīpa, would be four yojanas to the four cardinal directions, was variegated and beautiful to behold, was made of seven precious jewels (saptaratnaparipūrṇa), and was well adorned with five hundred gardens (udyāna);he had eighty-four thousand wives, and all of them were famously beautiful;he had eighty four thousand sons, and all of them were possessed of the power of a champion (mahānagnabala) and courage (parākrama).Son of good family, there were two wives of the king Puṇyālaṃkāra, and their names are Śrītejā and Śrīprabhā.When the king Puṇyālaṃkāra entered into the garden called ‘Sukhavyūha’ and stayed with his wives, from their the treasuries of the two wives, two sons were miraculously born, who have perfected previous practices, fulfilled vows, entered into the thought of incomparable complete awakening, and their name was Siṃha and Siṃhavikrāntagāmin.Immediately after those two sons were born, in one voice they spoke the following verses to their father, the kind Puṇyālaṃkāra:
165 Virtue and non-virtue previously performed will never be gone, offerings to the tathāgata will never be gone, resolution for the thought of awakening will never be gone, and the attainments of the most excellent learning will never be gone.166 Generosity, morality, vow (dānaśīlasaṃvara) will never be gone, the determination to be patient will never be gone, the application of vigour (vīryārambha) for the sake of gratefulness (kṛtajñatā) and making good actions (kuśalakarma) will never be gone.167 The liberation of thoughts by one-pointed meditation (ekāgradhyāna), never forgetting the profound reflection (nidhyāna) and insight (prajñā), making actions through knowledge (jñānakarma) all the time - because of these undisturbed dharmas, it is not difficult to attain awakening.168 One who is not sullied by vices, who is not established in womb (garbha), and who is miraculously born is unsullied just as a lotus does not get wet with water.169 The victorious one in the east, the Vaidyarāja, the well-gone one (sugata) who has the highest knowledge that is unattached to the three times (tryadhvāsaṅgajñānapara), for the sake of learning his dharma (dharmakāma), we are coming from the nearness of Vimalaprabhā.170 Just like the flower of the Udumbara, it is difficult to obtain the the coming of the tathāgata. In order to see and pay respect to him, father should go to the well-gone one.171 Having heard this teaching, the king, together with his sons, wives, retinues and hundreds of thousands creatures, proceeded to the tathāgata.2172 Having made suitable offerings to him with flowers and perfume, they bowed down to his feet, circumambulated him, saluted him with their hands placed together, and then sat down before him.173 Having bowed to the feet of the tathāgata, Siṃha and Siṃhavikrāntagāmin, the noble ones who are skilled in the meaning of the dharma (dharmārtha), uttered these verses:174 Since you are the refuge, the protector, and the last resort (śaraṇaparāyaṇatrāṇakaraṇa), you has become the light for the blind in the world and are expert in knowing the thoughts and actions of living beings (satvāśayacaritakuśala). May you make them live in accordance with their faith (yathādhimukti).175 This king longs for riches and happiness, is captivated by form, sound, and smell, never makes any offering, and does not even come to the nearness [of the tathāgata.] How could he hear the dharma?176 O protector, by producing compassion, in order that all bings may listen to the highest path (agrayāna) and never turn away from it, please teach the most excellent way of awakening (bodhipatha).177 The Lord, the protector, ascending to the height of eighty palm trees (tāla) in the open space, said to the king: “You should listen my highest dharma, and practice it.178 Desire is impermanent and so is kingship (rājya). Life (jīva) is like a dew-drop on the grass (tṛṇāvaśyāyabindhūpama), and in the same way, the pleasure of passion is like a dream. Which wise man would produce joy in this?179 Living beings are never satisfied because of desire, and thus again and again the thirst of desire is the cause. The fool who remain in the realm of objects (viṣaya) do not know how to be satisfied, and only those who are satisfied with insight (prajñā) are really satisfied.180 Just as an illusion (māyā) is deceptive and essenceless, it is taught that the five parts of the personality (pañcaskandha) are as an illusion (māyā), these spheres (dhātu) are as a serpent-venom (āśīviṣa), the six sense organs (ṣaḍindriya) are as an empty city (śūnyagrāma).181 Sons, wives, kingship, or even your kingdom is not your lasting friend when you are dying; the accumulation of disciplined sight, vow (saṃvara), and morality (śīla) are your friends who go to the other side [with you.]182 When you see my perfect visual form (rūpa), qualities (guṇa), eloquence (pratibhāna), and supernatural knowledges (ṛddhi), if you want to be like that, you should produce this highest awakening.183 Having heard this teaching, the elephant-king, together with seventy thousand koṭis of living beings, sons, wives, retinues, village people, produced the thought of awakening.184 We will produce the supreme thought, take care of all beings, gladly do the supreme conduct of the bodhisatva, and become unsurpassed awakened ones.
In that way, son of good family, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra, by all sorts of offerings (sukhopadhāna) and enjoyments (paribhoga) which were appropriate, beautiful and faultless, paid respect to the Lord and his disciples for eighty-four thousand years.Those two boys, Siṃha and Siṃhavikrāntagāmin, according to the teaching of the Lord, left ordinary household life behind and became renunciants (āgārād anagārikāṃ pravrajitaḥ).”After those became renunciants, twenty thousand princes also left ordinary household life and became renunciants.Then the monk Siṃha and Siṃhavikrāntagāmin vigorously applied themselves to the dharma that is the wings of awakening (bodhipakṣikadharma), austerity (saṃlekha), and practice in solitude, thereby they soon produced the five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā utpāditāḥ).Having attained supernatural knowledges (abhijñā), the two explained the dharma by their own magical power (ṛddhibala) and the power of vows (praṇidhānabala) in all world-spheres (sarvalokadhātu), brought immeasurable and incalculable living beings to maturity, and established them in the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).After eighty-four thousand years, son of good family, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra proceeded to the place where the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja stayed, and saw his two sons who became renunciants.Having thus seen, he produced a contemptuous attitude (paribhavacitta) about them, thinking: “While I have served the tathāgata through all sorts of offerings (sarvasukhopadhāna) for eighty four thousand years, what have they done?”Then, son of good family, the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja, having known the king Puṇyālaṃkāra’ thought, said this to Siṃhavikrāntagāmin:“By teaching the power of insight (prajñā), supernatural knowledges (abhijñā), merits (puṇya), and knowledges (jñāna), son of good family, make all the assembly happy, outshine (dhyāmīkṛta) all abodes of Māra (sarvamārabhavana), illuminate the way of awakening (bodhimārga), satisfy all living beings, defeat all opponents (parapravādin), light the lamp of the dharma (dharmolkā), purify all vices (sarvakleśa), and demonstrate the miraculous play of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvavikrīḍita)!”Then the bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin gently touched the open space with his hand, and just then the world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu) was shaken in six ways.Again he gently touched the open space with his hand, and then the sound of music played by hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of musical instruments resonated in open space.Again he gently touched the open space with his hand, and then the rain of flowers which has wonderful smell and which are pleasant to touch like a soft cloth (kācilindika) poured down from open space.Again he gently touched the open space with his hand, and just then the rain of all sorts of jewels (ratna), enjoyments (bhoga), and entertainments (samudācāra) poured down from the open space.Just as the rain of all kinds of requisites (pariṣkāra) poured down on the world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu), just so the rain of food and drink poured down.Then the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja said this to the king Puṇyālaṃkāra: “With giving gifts, great king, how much amount of this rain of jewels is falling?”Puṇyālaṃkāra replied: “O Lord, this rain of jewels is not easy to illustrate because it is immeasurable.”The Lord said: “O great king, if this bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin wishes, then, by the power of the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñānabala), such rain poured down on world-spheres as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā, and thus living beings in those world-spheres are satisfied according to their wishes.In this way, son of good family, when the rain of all kinds of jewels poured down from the open space, the gods of the earth (bhauma), filled with admiration, said that this bodhisatva is supposed to become the Gaganagañja.When such rain of all kinds of jewels poured down, just as the gods of the earth (bhauma) said, so the gods of the Cāturmahārājika heaven, the Trāyastriṃśa heaven, the Yāṃa heaven, the Tuṣita heaven, and the Nirmāṇarati heaven, filled with admiration, also said that this bodhisatva is supposed to become the Gaganagañja. Then the tathāgata Vimalaprabhānantaraśmirāja rejoiced (anumud-) in that name, and the buddhas as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅgā rejoiced in that name.Son of good family, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra, having seen the bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin’s power of supernatural knowledges (abhijñā), merits (puṇya) and knowledges (jñāna), handed over the crown to his son called Jayamati. Then, with conviction, he left ordinary household life behind and became a renunciant (śraddhayā āgārād anagārikāṃ pravrajitaḥ), and thought: “Giving (dāna) is the attachment of thoughts (cittasaṃrakta), but becoming a renunciant (pravrajyā) is the purification of thoughts;giving is the hinderance of body and speech (kāyavāc), but becoming a renunciant is the purification of body and speech;giving is the great hinderance, but becoming a renunciant is eliminating all hinderances;giving is grass and leaves (tṛṇaparṇa), but becoming a renunciant is obtaining essence and fruit;giving is constructing what belongs to me (mama), grasping it, and possessing it, but becoming a renunciant is giving away all you grasp;giving is not moving away from the view that there is a permanent substance (satkāyadṛṣṭi), but becoming a renunciant is the purification of all views (sarvadṛṣṭi);giving is a practice like child’s play, but becoming a renunciant is the state of discipline, calmness, and docileness (ājāneya).’Having this thought, he who became a renunciant carefully and vigorously practiced in solitude, and soon he produced the five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā utpāditāḥ).Son of good family, [if you think that,] at that time, the king Puṇyālaṃkāra was a someone else, you should not think so (na khalu punar evaṃ draṣṭavyam).Why is that? It is the tathāgata Krakucchanda, who, during that time, was the universal king Puṇyālaṃkāra (tat kasmād dhetoḥ | krakucchandaḥ sa tathāgato tena kālena samayena puṇyālaṃkāro nāma rājābhūc cakravartī).The bodhisatva Gaganagañja was at that time the bodhisatva Siṃhavikrāntagāmin, and thus for the first time the rain of jewels (ratnavarṣa) poured down from open space.For incalculable and immeasurable hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of aeons, the rain of jewels has poured down from the open space since his supernormal knowledge (abhijñā) is imperishable.I was, son of good family, at that time the bodhisatva Siṃha, and the bodhisatva Maitreya was at that time the prince Jayamati who succeeded to the crown by the king Puṇyālaṃkāra.Whosoever is delighted and purified in this words (pravacana), son of good family, that one will be the basis of living beings who generate the root of good (kuśalamūla).All the living beings who produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi) never turn back (avaivartika) from the awakening.When these discourses on amazing history (itihāsaka) were taught, twelve thousand beings produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).
The Bodhisatva Gaganagañja
Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the supramundane path (lokottaramārga) of the bodhisatvas, the great beings?”At these words, the Lord replied to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:Son of good family, what is called the supramundane path (lokottaramārga) is the six perfections (ṣaṭpāramitā), thirty-seven dharmas which are the wings of awakening (saptatriṃśadbodhipakṣikadharma), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded vision (vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions (catvāri dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of meditation (catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), and five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā). Son of good family, this is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.The world (loka) is the five parts of the personality (pañcaskandha).Thus, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent (anitya), suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, unproduced, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), the bodhisatva gives a gift, and enters into the suchness of giving (dānatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā).Then he understands the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of giving (dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the self. This the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, because he gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramundane path (lokottaramārga) of bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, the bodhisatva gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, unproduced, and dependently originated, he gives a gift.Having known that the consciousness (vijñāna) is isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), he gives a gift, and thus understands the suchness of giving through the suchness of consciousness.Then he understands the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of giving (dānatathatā), the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the self. This the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since the bodhisatva gives a gift by understanding suchness, this giving is the supramudane path (lokottaramārga) of bodhisatva.Again, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that the form (form) is impermanent (anitya), having protected the morality, etc., and having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), preserves the morality (śīlaṃ rakṣ-).Then he understands the suchness of morality (śīlatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā), the suchness of transforming (pariṇāmanatathatā) through the suchness of morality, the suchness of awakening (bodhitathatā) through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being (satvatathatā) through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self (ātmatathatā) through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) through the suchness of the self.The suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Since he understands the suchness, son of good family, this protecting the morality is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, the bodhisatva, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, having protected the morality, etc., and having known the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), protects the morality, and then understands the suchness of morality (śīlatathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā).He understands the suchness of transforming through the suchness of morality, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living being through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living being, and the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Since the bodhisatva understands suchness, this protecting the morality is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Again, son of good family, the bodhistva, having known that the form (rūpa) is impermanent, practices patience (kṣānti), makes a vigorous effort (vīryam ārabh-) according to what he understands, concentrates on meditation (dhyāna), and investigates insight (prajñā). Then he, having known that from the form is impermanent to the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), investigates insight.The bodhisatva understands the suchness of insight through the suchness of form, the suchness of transforming through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living beings through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since he understands the suchness, this preserving the morality is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.In that way, the bodhisatva, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, having investigated the insight, etc., and having known the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), investigates the insight. Then he understands the suchness of insight (prajñātathatā) through the suchness of consciousness (vijñānatathatā), the suchness of transforming through the suchness of insight, the suchness of awakening through the suchness of transforming, the suchness of living beings through the suchness of awakening, the suchness of the self through the suchness of living beings, the suchness of all dharmas through the suchness of the self. This suchness of all dharmas (sarvadharmatathatā) is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness (avitathatā), and nothing else but suchness (ananyathā). Son of good family, since he understands the suchness, this investigating the insight is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.Furthermore, son of good family, the bodhisatva, having known that the form is impermanent, having cultivated the application of awareness concerned with body (kāye kāyānupaśyanā smṛtyupasthānam), etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), cultivates the application of awareness concerned with body.The bodhisatva understands the suchness of body (kāyatathatā) through the suchness of form (rūpatathatā), and understands from the suchness of body to the suchness of all dharmas. This suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness, and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he cultivates the application of awareness concerned with body, and thus, son of good family, this absence of thought-constructions (nirvikalpa) through the thought-construction connected with body is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.In the same way, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are impermanent, just as the bodhisatva gives a gift more and more, he expands his feelings, thoughts and dharmas (vedanācittadharma). Thus he, having known that the form is impermanent, having practiced the application of awareness which consists in considering the dharma (dharme dharmānupaśyanā smṛtyupasthānam), etc., having known that the form is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and reflections (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), applies himself to the awareness which consists in considering the dharma.Thus, he, having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness is impermanent, having practiced the application of awareness which consists in considering the dharma, etc., having known the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), applies himself to the awareness which consists in considering the dharma.In that way, what is the suchness of the parts of the personality (skandhatathatā) is the suchness of the application of awareness (smṛtyupasthānatathatā). What is the suchness of the application of awareness is the suchness of transforming. What is the suchness of transforming is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness of awakening is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living beings is the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self is the suchness of all dharmas. What is the suchness of all dharmas is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness, and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he applies himself to the awareness concerned with the dharma, he does not make any thought-construction through the thought-constructions connected with the dharma, and thus such understanding is the supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.And so on, just as the bodhisatva develops the application of awareness (smṛtyupasthāna), in the same way, he develops correct elimination (samyakprahāṇa), the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda), sense organs (indriya), power (bala), the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), path (mārga), peaceful meditation (śamatha), expanded vision (vipaśyana), four means of attraction (catvāri saṃgrahavastūni), four meditaions (catvāri dhyānāni), four immeasurables (catvāry apramāṇāni), four formless states of meditation (catasra ārūpyasamāpattaya), five supernormal knowledges (pañcābhijñā).Then, since the bodhisatva attains the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having known that the form is impermanent, he, having known that the form is suffering (duḥkha), selfless (anātma), tranquil (śānta), empty (śūnya), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped (agrāhya), without basis (anālaya), unoriginated, like an illusion (māyā), like a dream (svapna), like a mirage (marīci), like the moon reflected in water (udakacandra), like an echo (pratiśrutkā), like a reflection (pratibhāsa), like a reflected image (pratibimba), and like grass, trees, walls, paths and reflection (tṛṇakāśṭhakuḍyamārgapratibhāsa), accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna).In that way, he accomplishes the knowledge of supernatural knowledges (abhijñājñāna) after having known that the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness are impermanent. Then he, having known the consciousness (vijñāna) is suffering, selfless, tranquil, empty, without distinguishing marks, wishless, unconditioned, unborn, unproduced, dependently originated, isolated, cannot be grasped, without basis, unborn, like an illusion, like a dream, like a mirage, like the moon reflected in water, like an echo, like a reflection, like a reflected image, and has the character of being beyond information (avijñāptilakṣaṇa), accomplishes supernatural knowledges.To wit, what is the suchness of the parts of the personality (skandhatathatā) that is the suchness of supernormal knowledges (abhijñātathatā). What is the suchness of supernormal knowledges that is the suchness of transforming. What is the suchness of transforming that is the suchness of awakening. What is the suchness of awakening that is the suchness of living beings. What is the suchness of living beings that is the suchness of the self. What is the suchness of the self that is the suchness of all dharmas. What is the suchness of all dharmas that is the absence of suchness, is not different from suchness, and nothing else but suchness. By understanding the suchness, he accomplishes the knowledge of supernormal knowledges (abhijñājñāna), and thus such understanding is the supramundane path of the bodhisatvas.Why is that? The supramunane path is to understand the suchness of form, thus the form is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent, dependently originated, and non-origination by its own nature (svabhāvenānutpanna).In the same way, the bodhisatva understands the suchness of feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness, thus consciousness is indestructible, uninterrupted, permanent, dependently originated, and non-origination by its own nature (svabhāvānutpatti).Transcending the world of the parts of personality (skandhaloka) is not to be attached to the world of form or the world without form, but to teach for living beings in the five state of existence (pañcagatyupapanna) to transcend the world, thus he teaches in that way but does not destroy the world.Why is that? Because the essential character (lakṣaṇa) that the world is impermanent is not destroyed. The world is essentially characterized by from suffering, selflessness, peace, emptiness, non-distinguishing mark, wishlessness, the unconditioned, to suchness, thus this impermanent world is, son of good family, the pure supramunane path of the bodhisatvas.The bodhisatva established on the pure path (mārgapariśuddhipratiṣṭhita) produces the great light of the dharma (mahāntaṃ dharmāvabhāsaṃ karoti) for the sake of living beings who are on the wrong path.Then those living beings, having attained the light, are also established in the true supramunane path.This path is the most excellent since it is for the sake of the obtainment of the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa);this path is excellent since it is without any bad thought (sarvākuśalacitta);this path is the best since it is to attain the summit (mūrdhan) for the sake of the knowledge of the buddha (buddhajñāna);this path is unsurpassed since it releases [living beings] from all the stream of existence (sarvaughottaraṇa);this path is unexcelled since it transcends all limited paths (sarvaprādeśikamārga);this path is incomparable since there is no concept of contrary (pratipakṣānupalambha);this path is unequalled (asamasama) since it is reciting (saṃgīti) the path of the previous buddhas (pūrvabuddha);this path leads to happiness since it vanquishes any Māra or adversary (nihatasarvamārapratyarthika);this path leads to no hindrance since it is the miraculous play (vikrīḍita) by knowing supernormal knowledges (abhijñā) and the base of magical power (ṛddhipāda);this path is without darkness (tamo’ndhakāra) since it is completely pure radiance by insight (prajñā);this path is righteous since it is without deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya);this path is luminous since there is no crooked thinking (akuṭilacitta);this path is impartial since it has the equal attitude to all living beings (sarvasatvasamacittatā);this path is vast (vipula) since it is open to all living beings (sarvasatvāvakāśa);this path is wide since there is no conflict between one another;this path is in the state of tranquility since it leads to the unbornness (anutpāda);this path is firm with merits (puṇya) because of the perfection of generosity (dānapāramitā);this path is without affliction (saṃtāpa) because of the perfection of morality (śīlapāramitā);this path is indestructible because of the perfection of forbearance (kṣāntipāramitā);this path can not be repulsed (avivārya) because of the perfection of vigour (vīryapāramitā);this path is free from any impurity (sarvarajavigata) because of the perfection of meditation (dhyānapāramitā);this path leads to the sameness of open space (gaganasamatā) because of the perfection of insight (prajñāpāramitā);this path is in accordance with knowledge (jñānānugamana) since it is without conceit (nirmānatā);this path is in accordance with cultivating all qualities of the buddha (sarvadharmaparibhāvana) since all good qualities are fully accomplished (sarvakuśaladharmasamudānīta).this path is in accordance with one who turns the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakrapravartanānugamana) since it keeps what has been taught before (pūrvāvisaṃvādanatā).Since those are the pure supramunane path of the bodhisatvas, son of good family, having been established in this pure path, the bodhisatva, wearing the great armour (mahāsaṃnāha), rides in this great vehicle (mahāyāna) and proceeds to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).
This is the armour of bodhisatvas; this is the armour of saving (uttāraṇasaṃnāha) those who do not yet cross over by the right practice as the great vessel (mahānāvasamyakprayoga);this is the armour of releasing those who are not yet liberated by being thoroughly liberated from all fetters of vices and views (sarvakleśadṛṣṭibandhana);this is the armour of consoling the unconsoled (anāśvāśvasasaṃnāha) by giving up the fear of eradicating all perishable properties (sarvaparigrahābhaya);this is the armour of liberating those who are not yet extinguished (aparinirvṛta) by teaching evenness for the inverted in nihilism;this is the armour of liberating all living beings through the conception that the self, living beings, life principle, and person do not exist (ātmasatvajīvapudgala);this is the armour of grasping the true dharma (saddharma) by not considering body or life (kāyajīvatanirapekṣa);this is the armour of purifying the buddha-field by never being satisfied with the accumulation of the roots of good (kuśalamūlasaṃbhāra);this is the armour of adorning the body with the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjanakāyālaṃkāra) by gathering various accumulations of generosity (dānasaṃbhāra);this is the armour of vanquishing all Māras and adversaries (sarvamārapratyarthika) by attaining supernormal knowledges (abhijñā);this is the armour of satisfying (saṃtoṣaṇa) all living beings through the knowledge of special knowledge (pratisaṃvidjñāna);this is the armour of seeking and hearing all dharmas of the buddha through the knowledge of memory (dhāraṇījñāna);this is the armour of seeing the thoughts of all living beings (sarvasatvacittadarśanasaṃnāha) through the knowledge of supernormal knowledges (abhijñājñāna);this is the armour of knowing the superior or inferior abilities of all living beings (sarvasatvendriyaparāparajñāna) by the insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna);this is the armour of fulfilling ten powers (daśabalaparipūraṇā) by the attainment of the power of insight and knowledge (prajñājñānabalasamudāgamana);this is the armour of attaining fearlessness (abhaya) because their resolutions never decrease;this is the armour of fulfilling the eighteen special qualities of the Tathāgata (aṣṭādaśāveṇikabuddhadharmaparipūraka) by fulfilling (paripūraṇa) all good qualities (sarvakuśaladharmaparipūraṇa) and by abandoning all bad qualities (sarvākuśaladharma);this is the armour of fearlessness (abhayasaṃnāha) of bodhisatvas because they do not become afraid (uttras-), frightened (saṃtras-) or fearful, even though they hear that all dharmas are like an illusion (māyā), a dream (svapna), a reflection (pratibhāsa), an echo (pratiśrutkā), the moon reflected in water (udakacandra);this is the armour of compassion (mahākaruṇāsaṃnāha) of bodhisatvas because they never give up any being, even though they know all living beings are basically in complete extinction (prakṛtiparinirvṛta);this is the armour of skillful means (upāyakauśalasaṃnāha) of bodhisatvas because they teach life, death, and birth, even though they hear that all dharmas are empty (śūnyatā), without distinguishing marks (animitta), wishless (apraṇihita), unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta), unborn (ajāta), and unoriginated (anutpanna);this is the undisturbed armour of magical presence (pūrvākopyādhiṣṭhānasaṃnāha) of bodhisatvas because they never realize (na sākṣātkṛ-) the fruit nor fall into (na pat-) cessation (nirodha), even though they understand the essential character entering into the state of being determined (niyāmāvakranti) and know that there is no origination of any conditioned thing (sarvasaṃskārānutpāda).The bodhisatvas, having clad themselves in this great armour, enter into the great vehicle (mahāyāna).
The great vehicle (mahāyāna) is made with four wheels (cakra), namely with the means of attraction (saṃgrahavastu),the spokes (ara) are well fitted as the roots of good (kuśalamūla) have been transformed (pariṇāmita) with intention (āśaya),it is well made with a deep nave (gambhīranābhi) as there is the immense knowledge of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādajñāna),it is well kept together by the axle (akṣa) in order to bear the burdens of all living beings (sarvasatvabhāra),the pole (īṣā) is firmly fixed since it is supported by the great friendliness and great compassion (mahāmaitrīmahākaruṇa),it is surrounded with the railing (vedikā) of all sorts of jewels as it is adorned with all the jewels of dharma (sarvadharmaratnasamalaṃkṛta),it is fastened with a strong girth (varatra) of the highest intention (adhyāśaya) since it surpasses one’s earlier promise (pūrvapratijñottaraka),it is carried on by a yoke (yugaṃdharavāhi) yoked with the team of insight and expedient means (prajñopāyayuganaddha),it is fastened in the holes of peaceful meditation and expanded vision (śamathavipaśyanā),it is powered by the power of understanding four holy truths (catuḥsatyaparijñābala),it has the power of a thousand well-bred horses (ājanya),it goes to all buddha-fields (sarvabuddhakṣetra) by four magical feet (ṛddhipāda),the horns (śṛṅga) of recollection are bound with the string of a jewel necklace (ratnamālā),it roams widely and broadly since it contains all living beings,it fulfills its function (sukṛtakarma) as it subdues enemies (pratyarthika) and the Māras (mārapratyarthika),it is applied with (prayukta) practical knowledge and wisdom (vidyājñāna),it is driven by an autopilot (adhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita),all buddhas in ten directions think of it,it is well adorned with a lion’s throne (siṃhāsana_samalaṃkṛta),is praised by all the gods, the king of the gods, and the highest god (sarvadevaśakrabrahmābhinandita),has good visual form that one never be satisfied with looking at (atṛptadarśana),is beautiful to behold (darśanīya),is unbreakable because it is firm as a diamond (vajradṛḍha),is unchangeable due to the promise (pratijñā) based on the firmness of the highest intention (sārādhyāśaya),is controlled and well-grasped by a charioteer (sārathi),is always led by the thought of awakening (bodhicittapūrvaṃgama),runs smoothly as it is attuned to the fulfilling of the qualities of vows (praṇidhānaguṇaparipūrṇānugata),obtains the light (ālokalabdha) of divine sight in the great view of ten directions (daśadigvilokitadivyacakṣur),has the pure and wide light of infinite rays (raśmi) so that it can illuminate the ten directions,is always filled with flowers because the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa), namely the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), continually pours down,is equipped with musical instruments which always produce the sound of dharma (dharmasvara),is in accordance with the mental capacity of followers,strives for all practices of bodhisatva (sarvabodhisatvacaryāparyeṣṭi),is superior because of infinite knowledge and immeasurable virtue (anantajñānaākāraguṇa),and is connected with the knowledge of knowing everything that is emptiness endowed with all sorts of excellencies (sarvākāravaropetaśūnyatāsarvajñajñānasamprayukta). Son of good family, the great vehicle (mahāyāna) is like that.Therefore, Good men (satpuruṣa), since the bodhisatva enters on the supramundane way (lokottaramārga) after having put on the armour, he appears to many beings, performing the deeds of the Buddha (buddhakārya), even without obtaining omniscience (sarvajñāna).”When this arrangement of way, armour, and vehicle was displayed, seventy-two thousand gods and human beings produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (iha mārgasaṃnāhayānavyūhe nirdiśyamāne dvisaptatīnāṃ prāṇidevamānuṣaṇām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni),and thirty-two thousand bodhisatvas attained the tolerance that all things are unborn by purifying the supramundane way (dvātriṃśatīnāṃ ca bodhisatvasahasrāṇām lokottaramārgapariśuddhyā anutpattikadharmakṣāntiḥ pratilabdhā).
Ratnaśrī
gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 6Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī addressed himself to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, was the supramunane way purified by you?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, it was purified by purifying myself.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how did you purify yourself?”Gaganagañja said: “Since this world is pure, son of good family, I am originally pure.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is the purity of the world?”Gaganagañja said: “Since the form (rūpa) is originally pure, it is deathless (acyuta).Since the form in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the form in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatāsthita).In the same way, since the feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are originally pure, those are deathless.Since the consciousness (vijñāna) in the future will be pure, it is without coming.Since the consciousness in the present is pure, it is established in the true state (dharmatā). Son of good family, this is the purity of the world.”Ratnaśrī said: “As for the pure world, where can we see it?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, you can see such pure world in all dharmas.”Ratnaśrī said: “How can we see all the dharmas?"Gaganagañja said: “It is when we know how to distinguish the past and future of all dharmas by means of insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna)”Ratnaśrī said: “How do you distinguish the past and future of all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation (pariccheda) or eternity (śāśvata).”Ratnaśrī said: “Where is no cessation or eternity?”Gaganagañja said: “Where there is no cessation or eternity there is no origination or extinction (anutpannāniruddhatā).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this place without origination or extinction?”Gaganagañja said: “It cannot be verbally expressed.”Ratnaśrī said: “Why is that?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the dharma is incalculable and ineffable.”Ratnaśrī: “Son of good family, how can you count the incalculable dharmas (asaṃkhyeyadharma)?”Gaganagañja said: “Just as, even though on the earth it is possible to measure open space, in open space it is impossible, just so, even though it is possible to measure by means of calculation (gaṇanamukhena), it is still impossible to measure by means of calculation. This is because the nature of the means of calculation is non-calculation.”Ratnaśrī said: “What then are the means of calculation and the means without calculation?”Gaganagañja said: “The means of calculation is conditioned (saṃskṛta), and the means without calculation is unconditioned (asaṃskṛta).Therefore, that which is without calculation in the unconditioned is beyond calculation, and that which is beyond calculation is unconditioned, thus the Lord said that by means of insight one should calculate, investigate, and give up what is to be given up.Accordingly, when the bodhisatva calculates the dharma in the conditioned, measures it in his consciousness, and reflects on it in the right way, he never sees any dharma which is to be fully known (parijñeya), to be eliminated (prahātavya), to be realized (sākṣātkartavya), or to be cultivated (bhāvayitavya).Since the bodhisatva never sees any dharma, he does not establish any dharma.Where he does not establish any dharma, there is the attainment of the absence of basis (anālaya).Where he attains the absence of basis, there is not anything to be wanted.Where there is nothing to be wanted, there is nothing to be obtained.Since he is free from mental conception (upalambha), there is nothing related to the self (amama) or nothing to be grasped (aparigraha).What is non-grasping? It is not grasping permanence or impermanence in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna);it is not grasping suffering or happiness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness; it is not grasping the self or selflessness in form, as well as in feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness;it is not grasping the beautiful or the ugly in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consciousness; it is not grasping emptiness or non-emptiness in from, as well as in [feeling, perception, formative factors or] consciousness.Even though he does not grasp anything, he attains concentration (samādhi). He stays within existence (saṃsāra), but he never grasps any vice of existence.Even though he makes living beings believe in extinction, he attained extinction from the beginning (ādiparinirvṛta).What then is the extinction of the bodhisatva?Extinction (parinirvāṇa) is the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskṛta).Even though the bodhisatva never makes even a small bad action (akuśalakarman), he still enters into grasping for the good actions (kuśaladharma).Since the bodhisatva makes all composite things (sarvasaṃskṛta) as belonging to body, speech, and mind (kāyavākcitta), he, having investigated them, transforms them into omniscience.He does not seek omniscience as form nor feeling, nor perception, nor formative factors, nor consciousness.Because he is not attached to his thoughts and morality, while fulfilling all his vows (sarvapraṇidhāna), he never sees (na samanupaśyati) the dharma in which there is increase or decrease.Since the dharma does not decrease nor increase, the bodhisatva, having attained the sameness of all dharmas (sarvadharmasamatā), performs the practice of a bodhisatva, being established in the absolute reality (dharmadhātu), thus he neither performs nor practices any dharma.Son of good family, the bodhisatva who has attained such extinction performs the practice of the bodhisatva (bodhisatvacaryā).Why is that? When the bodhisatva is established in the unconditioned (abhisaṃskāra) among all constructed, he attains extinction, and therefore the bodhisatva does not construct things among all the constructed things. Thus the unconditioned is called ‘extinction (parinirvāṇa)’ because it is not conditioned.Since the other shore (pāra) is that which does not enter into consciousness (vijñāna), the bodhisatva is characterized (prabhāvita) as having no conceptual activity (avijñapti), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is without distinguishing marks (animitta), the bodhisatva does not transform his thoughts into distinguishing marks, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is beyond false imagination (parikalpa), his thoughts do not enter into the imagination, thus it is called ‘extinction.’Since the other shore is baseless, he does not transform his thoughts into the absence of basis (anālaya), thus it is called ‘extinction.’Therefore, son of good family, this is the extinction of the bodhisatva, namely performing the practice of the bodhisatva.Then the Lord applauded the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja (atha khalu bhagavān gaganagañjāya bodhisatvāya mahāsatvāya sādhukāram adāt): “Well done, good man, well done (sādhu sādhu satpuruṣa). If it should be explained, I will say like that.”When this teaching was declared, five hundred bodhisatvas produced the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)].Then the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, we attained eloquence by this light of the dharma from the tathāgata (tathāgatadharmāloka).Just as forms appear in dependence on light, so we attained shining eloquence by the power generated by the tathāgata.”Then the bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, why do you hide your knowledge and teach that you attained eloquence by the presence of the Buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna)?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, all the eloquence of the bodhisatvas, even a small part of it, should be seen as the presence of the Buddha. Why is that? If the buddhas do not make those dharmas appear, how could the bodhisatva attain eloquence?”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how is the eloquence transferred?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, there is no transference [of eloquence,] but, nevertheless, the eloquence is attained by the eloquence of the Buddha.”Just as, even though ignorance (avidyā) is not transferred to the formative factors (saṃskāra), the formative factors are produced by the cause of ignorance, just so, even though the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere, by its cause the eloquence still arises.Just as the sounds of horses, elephants, and human beings (hayagajamanuṣyakāḥ śabdāḥ) are not transferred to an echo (pratiśrutkā) but because of it the echo (pratiśrutkā) arises, just so the eloquence of the Buddha is not transferred anywhere but by its cause the eloquence still arises.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) is profound (gambhīra).”Gaganagañja said: “In the same way any dharma is never born.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that there is no dependent origination of any dharma?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, if a certain agent (kartṛ) is in conditions, the dharmas will be born, but, because any agent is not apprehended in conditions, the agent is not apprehended in any dharma.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, what is it that the Tathāgata never appears?”Gaganagañja said: “if suchness arises, the tathāgata will appear, but still we hold the view that suchness never arises. Why is that? Suchness is brought about (prabhāvita) through non-arising. One who understands all dharmas just like the suchness, he is called the tathāgata.Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, why did the tathāgata come?”Gaganagañja said: “Something like that should be let alone (sthāpanīya).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is this letting alone?”Gaganagañja said: “Because the absolute truth (dharmadhātu) is in accordance with its proper place (yathāsthāna).”Ratnaśrī said: “What is the place of the absolute truth?”Gaganagañja said: “It is not the place of birth nor the place of death, it is neither a place nor non-place. Such a place is the place of the absolute truth, and just the place of absolute truth is the place of all dharmas.The place of all dharmas is not a place, and that which is not a place is without place because there is no place of birth or place of death, thus it is neither a place nor non-place. Such is the place of the tathāgata which is not considered as the place of birth nor the place of cessation.In this way, son of good family, that the tathāgata appears is an extreme (eko ’ntaḥ) and that the tathāgata never appears is another extreme, thus you should seek the tathāgata from the middle way (madhyamapratipad) which is free from both extremes, namely the existence of birth or the non-existence of birth.”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, although that the buddha arises from the absence of the place of birth or death is profound, son of good family, who would believe this appearing of the buddha?”Gaganagañja said: “One who does not make any matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa).”Ratnaśrī said: “Son of good family, how is ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ explained?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, ‘matter of dispute (adhikaraṇa)’ is a word for imputing (samāropa).One who does not impute anything to any dharma does not makes any matter of dispute concerning any dharma, therefore a word for ‘no matter of dispute’ is a word for sameness (samatā);a word for sameness is a word for the incomparable (asadṛśa);a word for the incomparable is a word for the absence of words (apada);a word for the absence of words is a word for the absence of letters (anakṣara);a word for the absence of letters is a word for the absence of information (avijñapti);a word for the absence of information, in which there is no activity (apracāra) of thoughts and mind (cittamanas), is a word for the absence of activity;Just as, even though bird-tracks do not remain in the sky, we still talk about it with the place of sound, in the same way, whether the buddha is born or unborn, we still talk about it with the word to be born.In that case, even though the bodhisatva teaches non-origination (anutpāda), he still makes things appear.Why is that? Because the essential nature of all dharmas (sarvadharmasvabhāva) is the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasavabhāva);the essential nature of unbornness (anutpādasvabhāva) is without own nature (niḥsvabhāva);that which has no essential nature, in that there is no existence;that in which there is no existence, that is established nowhere, thus all dharmas are the limit established nowhere (apratiṣṭhitakoṭi);the limit established nowhere is the limit of all dharmas, thus all the dharmas are called ‘being established in the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi)’;what is called the limit of reality is the unlimited limit (aparicchinnakoṭi);since the limit is in accordance with all limits, all dharmas appear as having attained the limit.Why is that? Because, even if the limit attains another part of the sky, it is still the same limit in the sky. Just as there is no border dividing the sky, just so there is no limit of any dharma (sarvadharmakoṭi) in the limit of reality (bhutakoṭi).Since the limit of reality is the limit of the self (ātmakoṭi), by knowing the limit of the self, the knowledge of the limit of all beings is understood.Since the limit of all dharmas is unified with the limit of all beings, all dharmas are called ‘the limit of exhaustion (kṣaya), the end of exhaustion, and the ultimate of exhaustion.’What is called ‘exhaustion (kṣaya)’ is a designation (adhivacana) for extinction (nirvāṇa), and thus all dharmas are the same as extinction.Why is that? Because it is without adversary (niṣpratipakṣa).Just as there is no adversary in open space, so there is no adversary in all dharmas.Those who seek extinction (nirvāṇa) in the perspective of an adversary see birth and death, and those who think that these dharmas will be born and will die never know the sameness of extinction (nirvāṇasamatā) since they practice in birth and death.Therefore, the Lord said “You should know! you should know! Do not dispute! Do not dispute! Fulfill the indisputable excellent qualities of ascetics (śrāmaṇa)!”
Ānanda
At that time, the venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord (atha khalu āyuṣman ānando bhagavantam etad avocat):“It is a marvelous thing, Lord, just as the bodhisatva Gaganagañja manifests his body, just so he teaches us.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, my body is manifested though, it is not manifested by myself.Why is that? Because open space is my body, it is manifested.”Ānanda said: “How then is your body manifested?”Gaganagañja said: “This is because, even though the buddha’s work (buddhakṛtya) is done by the body, the true body (dharmakāya), which is not undefiled, is not brought about through the parts of personality, spheres or fields of perception (skandhadhātvāyatana), nor born of the inverted body (viparyayakāya), but obtained by the mental body (manaskāya). In this way, the bodhisatva’s body is manifested.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, are you manifesting all dharmas?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, one should not think of my body separated from the dharma, it is the dharma itself, and the dharma itself is my body, in this way I manifest my body.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, if you manifested your body, are you an Arhat?”Gaganagañja said: “Having penetrated the entrance into the dharma which is free from impurity (araṇādharmamukhaprativedha), without desire (rāga), I do not have any aversion or bewilderment (dveṣamoha), thus I am an Arhat.”Ānanda said: “Son of good family, if you are a Worthy One, when did you reach complete extinction (parinirvāṇa)?”Gaganagañja said: “Venerable Ānanda, an Arhat does not reach extinction, and ordinary people (pṛthagjanā) are not Arhats who reach extinction.Why is that? Because an Arhat gives up the concept of extinction (nirvāṇasaṃjñā).Since ordinary people just produce the thought-constructions of extinction, to the extent that they made thought-constructions do they reach extinction.”Ānanda said: “According to our interpretation of what you said, son of good family, you are not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata.”Gaganagañja said: “Good, Ānanda, very good. Even though the bodhisatva, who is not an Arhat, ordinary man (pṛthagjana), one who is undergoing training (śaikṣa), one who no longer needs training (aśaikṣa), isolated buddha, bodisatva, or tathāgata, teaches every stage (sarvabhūmi), he is still not established in any place.”When this teaching was declared, in order to protect the dharma, five hundred disciples, immediately offering dharma-robes to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, said: “May all living beings attain eloquence such as this (sarvasatvā īdṛśasya pratibhānasya lābhino bhavantu)!”Then, by the magical presence of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the dharma-robes disappeared into open space.Then those monks, the Worthy Ones, said: “Son of good family, where did the dharma-robes go?”Gaganagañja said: “They went into the treasury of open space.”Then the Lord smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda asked the meaning of smiling: “O Lord, as the tathāgata does not smile for no reason, what is the reason for smiling?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja received five hundred robes by those five hundred monks, put them into the treasury of open space, sprinkled on the world-sphere called Kāṣāyadhvaja. In this way he performed the buddha-activities (buddhakārya) in the buddha-field of the tathāgata Parvatarāja. Then the religious discourses given by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja arose from those dharma-robes in the buddha-field, and hundreds koṭis of bodhisatvas attained the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti)] by the teaching of the dharma.Ānanda, you should see the sphere of supernatural power and knowledge (ṛddhijñānaviṣaya) of the bodhisatva in order to bring various living beings to maturity (anekaparyāyasatvaparipācana).When this teaching was taught, the great rain of flowers, which have been never seen before, shining brilliantly like the radiant sun and moon (candrasūrya), poured down, and a voice resonated from those flowers: “Having heard this teaching of the bodhisatva Gaganagñja, those living beings with faith, being sealed with the irreversible seal (avaivartikamudrā), will be devoted themselves to the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa).”Ānanda said: “O Lord, where are these flowers coming from?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, who reigned over one hundred thousand world-spheres, sprinkled these flowers in order to worship (pūjākarmaṇa) the bodhisatva Gaganagañja.”Ānanda said: “O Lord, we would like to see him.”The Lord said: “Just wait a minute, Ānanda, you will see him soon.”
Prabhāvyūha
At that time, the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha, being surrounded and followed (parivṛta) by sixty-eight hundred thousand Brahmās, teleported from the world of Brahmā to the presence of the Lord (brahmaloke antarhitaḥ bhagavato ’ntike prātiṣṭhata), bowed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ pādau śirobhir vanditvā), circumambulated him three times (tripradakṣiṇīkṛṭya), and sat down on a side.Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, the greatness (māhātmya) of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s morality, concentration, supernormal knowledge, knowledge, insight, fulfilling vows, skillful means, highest intention, mastery of the dharma, ornaments for body, speech and thought, and mastery over all dharmas (śīlasamādhyabhijñājñānaprajñāpraṇidhānaparipūraṇopāyakauśalādhyāśayadharmeśvarakāyavākcittālaṃkārasarvadharmavaśitā) are marvelous (āścarya)!Since the bodhisatva Gaganagañja has purified his former activities, he manifests all activities by body, speech, and thought without any effort. O Lord, since his former roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūla) have been not yet repaid by anyone, that the bodhisatva Gaganagañja roars this lion’s roar (siṃhanādanādi) in the present time is the outcome of the profound practice in the past.”The Lord said: “Quite so, it is just as you have said. The incomparable complete awakening of the bodhisatvas arises from the former roots of good, merits, and knowledges (pūrvakuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “O Lord, what is the root of good of the bodhisatvas, what is the merit, what is the knowledge?”The Lord said: “Brahmā, ‘the root of good (kuśalamūla)’ is the initial resolution to strive for awakening (prathamacittotpādika), and the root of all qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmamūla);‘merit (puṇya)’ is, as soon as the thought of awakening is produced, to conquer all items of meritorious action consisting in generosity, morality, and meditational self-cultivation of all disciples and isolated buddhas (sarvaśrāvakapratyekabuddhānāṃ dānamayaṃ śīlamayaṃ bhāvanāmayaṃ sarvapunyakriyāvastvabhibhāvana);‘knowledge (jñāna)’ is to accumulate the root of good, and to transform the accumulations into omniscience (sarvākārajñatā).Further, ‘the root of good’ is pure intention (śuddhāśaya) since it is without deception or guile (māyāśāṭhya), ‘merit’ is the practice (prayoga) for all merits, etc., and ‘knowledge’ is the highest intention (adhyāśaya) of going to a different state (viśeṣagamana).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the solemn vow of good teachings (kuśaladharma), ‘merit’ is never being content (asaṃtuṣṭi) with the accumulation of the roots of good, and ‘knowledge’ is to consider the roots of good as an illusion.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to have spiritual friends (kalyāṇamitra), ‘merit’ is not abandoning spiritual friends (kalyāṇamitrāparityāga), and ‘knowledge’ is asking questions to spiritual friends.Further, ‘the root of good’ is aiming at the dharma (dharmārthika), ‘merit’ is striving for the dharma (dharmakāma), and ‘knowledge’ is taking pleasure in the delights of the dharma (dharmārāmaratirata).Further, ‘the root of good’ is seeking the dharma (dharmaparyeṣṭi), ‘merit’ is teaching the dharma without a view

alms-bowls (cīvarapiṇḍapāta), and ‘knowledge’ is to usufruct (paribhoga) them without desire or greed.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to practice the presences of recollection (smṛtyupasthāna), ‘merit’ is fulfilling the correct eliminations (samyakprahāṇaparipūraṇa), ‘knowledge’ is attaining the bases of magical power (ṛddhipāda).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the entrance into the ability of faith (śraddhendriya), ‘merit’ is in accordance with vigour, recollection, and awareness (vīrya_smṛtisaṃprajanya), and ‘knowledge’ is the cultivation of concentration and insight (samādhiprajñā).Further, ‘the root of good’ is to be established in the five powers (pañcabala), ‘merit’ is to understand the limbs of awakening (bodhyaṅga), and ‘knowledge’ is to know the entrance into the path (pathapraveśajñāna).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the happiness in mind (pramuditacitta), ‘merit’ is seeking for peaceful meditation (śamathasaṃbhāraparyeṣṭi), and ‘knowledge’ is the skillfulness in the expanded vision (vipaśyanakauśalya).Further, ‘the root of good’ is the item of meritorious action consisting in generosity (dānamayaṃ puṇyakriyāvastu), ‘merit’ is the item of meritorious action consisting in morality (śīlamayaṃ puṇyakriyāvastu), and ‘knowledge’ is the item of meritorious action consisting in meditational self-cultivation (bhāvanāmayaṃ puṇyakriyāvastu).Further, ‘the root of good’ is training in the highest morality (adhiśīla), ‘merit’ is training in the highest thought (adhicitta), and ‘knowledge’ is to practice the highest insight (adhiprajñā).Further, ‘the root of good’ is to confess all sins (sarvapāpapratideśana), ‘merit’ is to take pleasure in all merits (sarvapuṇyānumodanā), and ‘knowledge’ is to request [teachings from] all buddhas

transform the unconditioned morality (anabhisaṃskāra) into awakening.Further, ‘the root of good’ is not to be hostile towards all beings (sarvasatvāpratigha), ‘merit’ is to be patient with unpleasant words, and ‘knowledge’ is to abandon his body and life in order to bring all being to maturity, and to transform it into awakening.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to undertake all good dharmas (sarvadharmābhibhāvana), ‘merit’ is the eagerness for all roots of good (sarvakuśalamūlacchanda), and ‘knowledge’ is to enter into the sameness in the absence of distinguishing mark (animittasamapraveśa), and to transform the roots of good into awakening.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to seek the limbs of meditation (dhyānāṅgaparyeṣṭi), ‘merit’ is not to make former roots of good disappear by attaining the meditation, and ‘knowledge’ is to be born in the desire realm (kāmadhātu) after having returned from the meditation.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to learn the root of

(sarvasatvasamacitta), ‘merit’ is to meditate on friendly thoughts (maitrīcittasamāpatti), and ‘knowledge’ is to be friendly to all beings with the sameness of open space.Further, ‘the root of good’ is to accumulate in three stages, ‘merit’ is to accumulate in four stages, and so forth, and ‘knowledge’ is to fulfill the tenth stage.Further, ‘the root of good’ belongs to the bodhisatvas who have generated the initial determination to seek awakening (prathamacittotpādikānāṃ bodhisatvānām), ‘merit’ belongs to the bodhisatvas who have entered their practice (caryāpratipannānāṃ bodhisatvānām), and ‘knowledge’ belongs to the bodhisatvas who are never to turn back (avaivartikānāṃ bodhisatvānām).Further, ‘the root of good’ is to touch the evenness of the sole of the foot (pādatala), ‘merit’ is to adorn the characteristics of a great man and the marks of beauty (lakṣaṇānuvyañjanālaṃkāra), and ‘knowledge’ is not to see the top of the head (anavalokitamūrdha).Further, ‘the root of good’ is to adorn the buddha-fields (buddhakṣetrālaṃkāra), ‘merit’ is to enjoy food and drink (pānabhojana) mentally, and ‘knowledge’ is to be produced in intelligent beings (tīkṣṇendriyasatva).Further, ‘the root

‘merit’ is to subdue all Māras, and ‘knowledge’ is to attain the incomparable perfect awakening (bodhim abhisaṃbudh-) through insight that is associated with a moment of thought (ekacittakṣaṇasamāyuktaprajñā).In this way, Brahmā, the bodhisatva arises from the root of good, merit, and knowledge (kuśalamūlapuṇyajñāna).”Then the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha said this to the Lord: “It is a marvelous, Lord, that the tathāgata explains all sorts of qualities of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmanānātva) by means of these three root words [or stages] (mūlapada).”At these words, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said to the Brahmā Prabhāvyūha: “Brahmā, everything is included in a single word (ekapadasamavasṛta).Why is that? The word ‘emptiness (śūnyatā)’ is a single word, and everything is included in emptiness;the word ‘signlessness (ānimitta)’ is a single word, and everything is included in signlessness;the word ‘wishlessness (apraṇihita)’ is a single word, and everything is included in wishlessness;in the same manner, the words ‘the unconditioned (anabhisaṃskāra), non-desire (virāga), peace (śānti), non-basis (anālaya), the absolute truth (dharmadhātu), suchness (tathatā), the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), inexistence (asaṃbhava), and unbornness (anutpāda), each of them is a single word, [and everything is included in them];the word ‘extinction (nirvāṇa)’ is a single word, and everything is included in extinction.Further, Brahmā, desire (rāga) is a word for non-desire. Why? Because desire is the essence of non-desire (virāgasvabhāva). Thus everything is included in the essence of desire (rāgasvabhāva).Aversion (dveṣa) is a word for non-aversion (adveṣa). Why? Because aversion is the essence of non- aversion (aveṣasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of aversion.Bewilderment (moha) is a word for non-bewilderment (amoha). Why? Because bewilderment is the essence of non-bewilderment (amohasvabhāva). Thus everything is the essence of bewilderment.Aggregation of perishable things (satkāya) is a word for no aggregation of perishable things. Why? Because aggregation of perishable things is the essence of no aggregation of perishable things. Thus everything is the essence of aggregation of perishable things.Form (rūpa) is a word for the absence of form. Why? Because form is the essence of absence of form. Thus everything is the essence of form.In the same way, feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness (vedanāsaṃjñāsaṃskāravijñāna) are words for the absence of feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness. Why? Because feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness are the essence of absence of them. Thus everything is the essence of feeling, perception, formative factors and consciousness.It is the same for fields, sense perceptions (dhātvāyatana), and the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅga pratītyasamutpāda).Ignorance (avidyā) is a word for the absence of ignorance. Why? Because ignorance is the essence of the absence of ignorance, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of ignorance.Birth is a word for no birth (anutpāda). Why? Because birth is the essence of no birth, all dharmas of the buddha are the essence of birth.All teachings of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharma) is a word for no teaching (adharma). Why? Because everything is the essence of no thought-construction (avikalpa), all teachings of the buddha are the essence of all teachings.Brahmā, those are the door of entering into a word for dharma called (dharmapada) ‘the entrance into the word without word (apadapadapraveśa)’ in which all dharmas of the buddha are included in one single word.Just as, Brahmā, all streams flow into the great ocean (mahāsāgara), just so all qualities of the buddha are included in a single word ‘the entrance into the dharma (dharmamukha).’Just as, Brahmā, all manifestations of forms (sarvarūpāvabhāsa) appear in open space, just so all teachings of the buddha are included in a single word, thus this word is the inexhaustible word and the word which is split into one hundred thousand.Just as, Brahmā, even though all of one hundred thousand are included in a single word which is split into one hundred thousand, and even though those have been removed after having been split for a thousand years, the muchness of one hundred thousand is neither established in the connection with that word nor connected to ‘one hundred thousand,’ just so, Brahmā, while calculating and measuring to split the qualities of the buddha for many hundreds of thousands of aeons, the qualities of the buddha are never experienced by body or thought, thus those are impossible to be explained and too much to be explained.Further, muchness is non-muchness. Why is that? If someone obtained so much or not so much, it would be just as much as he obtained because there is no muchness or non-muchness. Thus it is impossible to say that it is much or not much.Brahmā, calculating the dharmas of the buddha is calculating all dharmas. Why is that? Because all dharmas are the dharmas of the buddha, and the dharmas of the buddha are neither the dharmas nor non-dharmas.Why is that? The dharmas of the buddha cannot be mentally constructed (parikalpita) by perception (saṃjñā), or rather, those are taught in order to fully know the perception. Thus the thought-construction (parikalpa) that there is neither perception nor non-perception is neither the dharma nor the non-dharma.Brahmā, since the dharmas of the buddha have such an essential character (lakṣaṇa), by their own essential character, they are pure and transcendent (svalakṣaṇapariśuddhasvalakṣaṇavivikta).Since own essential character (svalakṣaṇa) is the absence of essential character (alakṣaṇa), the open space has no essential character and it is characterized as all dharmas.When this religious discourse was given by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, twelve thousand Brahmās in the assembly produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening, and five thousand Brahmās, who had planted the well prepared roots of good (parikarmāvaropitakuśalamūla), attained the tolerance that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).
The Bodhisatva Ratnapāṇi
gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 7Then the bodhisatva Ratnapāṇi said to the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, by what dharma in which the thought of awakening (bodhicitta) is included you never fall back?”Gaganagañja said: “Son of good family, the thought of awakening is included in two dharmas by which you never fall back. What are these two?

dharmas (sarvadharmasamāsanirdeśa). If I were to explain the dharmas in more than one word or more than two words, the true state of the dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā) would never be exhausted to an aeon or more than an aeon (kalpaṃ vā kalpāvaśeṣaṃ vā), but my eloquence (pratibhāna) also will not be exhausted.When this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), a chapter of the collection of dharma (dharmasaṃgraha), was taught, the bodhisatva Ratnapāṇi covered this world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu) with his precious right hand (ratnadakṣiṇapāṇi) in order to pay respect (pūjākarmaṇa) to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja and his exposition of religion.In that very moment, from his precious right hand, flowers (puṣpa), incense (gandha), garlands (mālā), unguents (upalepana), aromatic powers (cūrṇa), robes (cīvara), parasols (chattra), banners (dhvaja), pennons (patākā), and whatever sound of musical instruments poured down on the worlds of the ten directions (daśadiglokadhātu).All the world system of three thousandfold worlds was covered with the rain of flowers up to the height of the knees (jānumātra);all the vault of the sky was adorned with parasols, banners, pennons, and robes (chattradhvajapatākācīvara);and the following verses issued from the sound of musical instruments:
185 This good man, who is filled with one hundred kinds of good qualities, keeping and spreading his qualities, overcomes evil beings and attains recollection, intelligence and understanding (smṛtimatigati). When the voice of the best ascetic (śramaṇavara) resonates, cyclic existences in the ten directions are purified.186 He, who is filled with sublime confidence (adhimukti), who is free from impurities (rajas) and darkness (tamas), purifying a hundred [previous] existences, leading gods and humans (devamānuṣa) to the sphere without destruction, being endowed with ten powers and the sky-like mind, becomes free from existence.187 As he purifies his speech gracefully and gloriously, he has no harshness, erroneousness, or impurity. Since he is incomparable in the three states of existence (tribhava), he is respected by gods and humans. Being free from existence, he brings happiness and benefits to living beings.188 He, who trains himself with confidence, recollection, intelligence and understanding (adhimuktismṛtimatigati), conquers the power of others (parabala) by means of ten powers (daśabala) and superior powers, defeats enemy troops, and attains the state of immortality. O good man, beyond existence, the voice of the wise resonates.189 Even though he does not go anywhere separated from this assembly, he educates gods and humans without moving in ten directions. He does not stay any particular place, but he stays with his intelligence and is unwavering in the realm of the dharma (dharmadhātu), just as earth is unshakable.190 As the sunshine removes darkness and impurities, so does this good man. He, who is united with the light of insight, spreads glorious light, thereby all the realm of Māra, having been filled with the light of the Sage (muni), is outshone (dhyāmīkṛta).191 Just as the wind in open space enters everywhere without any base (sthāna) and has no thought-constructions (avikalpa) or false imagination (parikalpa), just so the sons of the buddha (jinaputra) whose minds are like open space are in accordance with all living beings and thus they are respected by gods and humans.192 The water in the ocean (sāgarajala) of three thousandfold worlds is measurable, a bird-track in the sky (gaganaśakunipada) in ten directions is expressible, and someone can have the same thought as all living beings; but the great qualities (mahāguṇa) of the son of the Sage (muni) are inexhaustible.
Māra Pāpīyān
When this teaching was taught and verses were accomplished, the wicked Māra, having magically created four kinds of troops (caturaṅgabala), came to the courtyard where the Lord stayed with them, stationed them on the outside of the courtyard, disguised himself as a householder (gṛhapati), went in front of the Lord, and bowed down at his feet (bhagavataḥ pādau śirobhir vanditvā), saying:“Because these good men, the bodhisatva Gaganagañja and Ratnapāṇi, are endowed with immeasurable good qualities, and so are the other bodhisatvas, it is possible to manifest such wonderful teachings (āścaryādbhutadharma) and magical displays (prātihārya) in this world. However, Lord, will there be someone believing these magical displays in the future?”The Lord said: “As a small amount of water in the great ocean can be lifted up by means of the tip of a hair (vālāgrakoṭi), so few beings will have faith in the magical displays (prātihārya) of these good men. However, there will be great many beings who do not have faith, compared to the quantity of water in the ocean.”Having heard this word, the wicked Māra, became contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant (atha khalu māraḥ pāpīyāṃs tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajāto bhavati), danced and was about to leave the congregation.The the venerable Śāriputra addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, who is this man (puruṣa) going away from this congregation with so much pleasure?”The Lord said: “O Śāriputra, he is the Māra, who, disguised as a householder, came to the tathāgata in order to make this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) disappear. Having heard that there will be only few beings who have belief in this religious exposition, he is about to leave this congregation, joyfully singing, ‘There will be only few followers of the ascetic Gautama, but mine will be numerous.’”At that time the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said to the wicked Māra: “Wicked One, why are you leaving after having shown your true colors?”Then the wicked Māra thought: “Because the bodhisatva Gaganagañja and other bodhisatvas will come to my territory (māragocara), to say nothing of the tathāgata (prāg eva tathāgataḥ). So now I will go back to my territory.”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, having stopped the wicked Māra and his servants in the vault of the sky, exercised his magical power in such a way (tathādhiṣṭhita) that they could not go back to his territory, and said this to the Māra: “Wicked One, as open space is without obstruction (anavṛti), why do you not go back to your territory?”Māra said: “Son of good family, the sky is without obstruction (gaganam anāvṛtam) to you, but it looks dark to us. The only we can see in front of us is darkness (tamo’ndhakāra), except for the congregation (parṣanmaṇḍala) of the Buddha on the ground, which looks luminous.”Gaganagañja said: “So it is, Wicked One, it is beings who have the light of the dharma in their thoughts (śukladharmacittasatva), and the darkness in front of you is because of the works of Māra (mārakarman).”Māra said: “O good man, from now on I will never do the works of Māra.”Gaganagañja said: “As it is difficult to keep your promise among such wicked beings, you should come down here and listen the discipline of the dharma (dharmavinaya) taught by the tathāgata, together with your servants.”Then the wicked Māra and his servants unwillingly (akāmaka) went down from the vault of the sky, and the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the congregation of bodhisatvas: “Sons of good family, may all of you elucidate (pratibhātu) the gates into the dharma of transcending the path of the works of Māra (mārakarmamārgasamatikramadharmamukha).”The bodhisatva Kāñcanaparvatarāja thereupon said: “Giving up your sphere is to be attached to the sphere of Māra (māraviṣaya). Knowing that everywhere is the sphere of the buddha (buddhaviṣaya) is to know the sphere of the buddha. If you do not see the sphere of the buddha, how can you see your own sphere? In that way the bodhisatva who has transcended the sphere has also transcended the sphere of Māra. This is the gate into the dharma of transcending the sphere of Māra.”The bodhisatva Ratnaśrī said: “Since the objects of thought is the sphere of Māra (māragocara), where there is not any dharma perceived, what would be accomplished by Māra there? Since the attainment is without basis, the understanding through time that there is no attainment with basis is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of Māra of the bodhisatva.’”The bodhisatva Ratnapāṇi said: “When you grasp or possess something, then the Māra will find your weak point (avatāraṃ labh-). When you do not grasp any dharma, there will be no disagreement with anyone. When you are alone without the second, you do not make your own thinking or own place [into problem], and then how can you stay together with the Māra? Thus the bodhisatva who is established in nothing transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Āryaratna said: “‘Sin’ (āpatti) is an accusation, and in such an accusation the Māra can find a weak point. What is the absence of sin (anpatti) is not to enter into the consciousness of following in accordance with the distinguishing marks [of sins] (nimittānusāriṇavijñānāpraveśa), and thus the bodhisatva who is established in the limit of no distinguishing mark transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Ratnacitta said: “The Lord taught that vices (kleśa) are just like a reflection (pratibimba) and an illusion (pratibhāsa). Knowing that the reflection and illusion are not changing nor not changing, not coming nor going, without inside nor outside, and remain in no location or dimension (sthānāsthānavigatā) is not living with any vice. The vices do not arise due to the absence of thought-construction; the vices do not cease due to the absence of thought-construction. In this way, the bodhisatva who is established in the absence of thought-construction and false imagination transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Ratnākara said: “Happiness is a latent tendency (anuśaya); unhappiness is an obstruction. One who is without happiness or unhappiness does not have any affection (anunaya) or hostility (pratigha). One who is without affection or hostility is established in sameness. One who is established in sameness does not differentiate any dharma. One who is established in the absence of differentiation does not think about sameness or non-sameness. When you obtain this inconceivable dharma, the Māra cannot find your weak point.”The bodhisatva Ratnaparityāga said: “The works of Māras (mārakarman) is produced from obsession with self (ātmasamutthāna). When you are established in the purity of self, what can the Māra do? Why is that? Because vices are purified by the purity of self (ātmaviśuddhi), and all dharmas are purified by the purity of vices. That which purifies all dharmas purifies open space. Thus the bodhisatva who is established in the purity of open space transcends the sphere of the Māra.The bodhisatva Dharmarāja said: “Just as one, who obtains the consecration of the king (rājābhiṣeka), and who has power and numerous attendants, is fearless, just so the bodhisatva, who obtains the consecration, and who has the attendants of the jewel of the dharma (dharmaratna), has no fear of any Māra. Here the consecration is to reach the extreme of the qualities of the buddha (paryantabuddhadharma) and to fulfill them, and the attendants of the jewel of the dharma (dharmaratna) is to learn the dharmas taught by the buddhas in ten directions. Since the bodhisatva who is established in such a way transcends the sphere of the Māra, this is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra.’”The bodhisatva Śailaśikharasaṃghaṭṭanarāja said: “Just as the wind enters through a chink, just so the Māra can find a weak point where there is a chink in thought. The bodhisatva therefore should not have any chink in his thought.

Here, seeing the buddha is not to see form, feeling, perception, formative factors or consciousness. The correct seeing (samyagdṛṣṭi) is to see the buddha. Seeing the dharma is not to make any mental effort (manasikāra). The unchanging seeing is to be free from attachment (rāga). Being free from attachment is to see the dharma. That the bodhisatva comes to be endowed with seeing the buddha and his dharma in that way is transcending the sphere of the Māra. This is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra.’”The bodhisatva Indrajālin said: “Since the deeds of the Māra arises from action [of speech], mental activity and movements [of body] (iñjitamanyanāsyandita), the bodhisatva should be free from the basis of action [of speech], mental activity and movements [of body], which are superficial mental activities (ayoniśomanasikāra). With the thorough practice (yoniśaḥprayoga), the bodhisatva who is free from action [of speech], mental activity and movements [of body] transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Guṇarājaprabhāsa said: “As many as there are antidotes (pratipakṣa), so many are the works of the Māra (mārakarman). The absence of antidote is [included in] the realm of the dharma (dharmadhātu), and all dharmas are [included in] the realm of the dharma. Since all dharmas are included in the realm of the dharma (dharmadhātusamavasaraṇa), all the dharmas are understood through understanding the realm of the dharma. The works of the Māra is not apprehended apart from the realm of the dharma, and the realm of the dharma which is the same as the works of the Māra is not different from suchness (tathatā). In this way, the bodhisatva who enters into one single principle (ekanaya) transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Gandhahastin said: “The weak (durbala) can be harmed by the Māra; but the strong (balika) cannot be harmed by the Māra. The weak is afraid of the three gates of liberation (trivimokṣamukha). Since the strong is not afraid of the three gates of liberation, namely, directly seeing (pratyakṣa), penetrating (supratividdha), and meditatively cultivating. One who is not afraid of them transcends the sphere of the Māra, and thus this is the gate into the light of the dharma (dharmālokamukha) called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Maitreya said: “Just as the water in the great ocean (mahāsāgara) has a single taste (ekarasa), so all dharmas in the great ocean of the knowledge of the dharma (dharmajñānasāgara) have a single taste. Since the works of the Māra (mārakarma) and the works of the buddha (buddhakarma), both are same in the perspective of emptiness (śūnyatā), signlessness (animitta), wishlessness (apraṇihita), birthlessness (ajāti), and the absence of origination (anutpāda), the bodhisatva who enters into the single taste (ekarasa) transcends the sphere of the Māra.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “O friends (vata mārṣāḥ), since open space transcends all spheres, it is not the sphere of sight (cakṣurviṣaya), and likewise it is not the sphere of hearing, smelling, tasting, body and mind (śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamanaḥ). Since all dharmas are the sphere of the essential nature of open space (gaganasvabhāva), body and speech (kāyavāc) are the light of knowledge (jñānāloka) in accordance with the sameness of open space (gaganasamatā). Thus the bodhisatva who obtains this light of knowledge transcends the sphere of the Māra, and this is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra.’”The bodhisatva Mañjuśrī said: “O good man, all you have said is the works of the Māra and the sphere of the Māra. Why is that? Things expressed by words are a mere information (vijñapti); but the speech of the buddha (buddhaghoṣa) is beyond verbal expressions (anakṣara). Since, as many as are words, so many are the works of the Māra, when there is not any word, nothing would be done by the Māra. Since that which is without word is without information, one never perceives the self or other (na ātmaparaṃ samanupaśyati). Since there is no self or others, the dharma which causes benefit or harm does not exist. Understanding like this is transcending the sphere of the Māra, and, son of good family, this is the gate into the dharma called ‘Transcending the sphere of the Māra of the bodhisatva.’”Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja said this to the wicked Māra: “Wicked One, did you hear this gate into the dharma of transcending the sphere of the Māra?”Māra said: “Yes, I heard.”Gaganagañja said: “Wicked One, are you still going to do the works of the Māra among the bodhisatvas who entered into such guiding principle of the dharma (dharmanaya)?”Māra said: “Son of good family, by hearing this gate into the dharma of transcending the sphere of the Māra, I would not dare to do the works of the Māra among those who listen to it, to say nothing of the bodhisatvas who see it directly (pratyakṣa) by their knowledges.”At that time, four gods, Saṃcayavigata, Sukhasaṃcaya, Gandhavat, and Prāsādavat, who guarded the bodhisatvas, said to the Wicked Māra:“In the past, at the place of awakening (bodhimaṇḍa), the Lord met you, your forces, troops, army and servants directly. At that time, the Lord touched the ground with the jewels in his hand (ratnapāṇi), which are the accumulation of friendliness, compassion, generosity, discipline, restrain, gentleness, morality, learning, concentration, insight, firm and burning effort, merit and knowledge (maitrīkaruṇadānavinayasaṃyamasauratyaśīlaśrutasamādhiprajñādṛḍhottaptavīryapuṇyajñānasaṃbhāra), and then the endless, limitless worlds (anantāparyanteṣu lokadhātuṣu) were shaken. In that way it was manifested that you and your forces were defeated, but will you still do the works of Māra under the Lord and the bodhisatvas? You should pay homage to the tathāgata and the assembly of the bodhisatvas!”Then the Wicked One, having conjured up canopies adorned with eighty four thousand jewels (ratnacchattra), offered them to the congregations. Having held numerous kinds of divine flowers (divyapuṣpa), incense (gandha), garlands (mālā) and unguents (upalepana), he scattered them on the place where the Lord stayed, and said this to the Lord together with his servants: “If the bodhisatva Gaganagañja gives us the treasury of open space (gaganagañja), we will produce the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi).”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja said: “Wicked One, do you see this treasury of open space?”Māra said: “I see it, son of good family. It is far greater than all the displays of desire realm, buddha-fields, and my own abode (svabhavana), and it is full of the jewels for gods and humans.Gaganagañja said: “Wicked One, I will give you all these treasuries of open space so that you can produce the thought of the incomparable complete awakening.”Then the wicked Māra, together with his eighty-four thousand creatures, produced the thought of the incomparable complete awakening.At that time, Durmukha who was the head of five hundred sons of the Māra, lacking faith and desiring the non-dharma (adharmakāma), said: “Even though our father produced the thought of awakening, we should strive against this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya).”Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, elucidate the words of knowledge-mantra (vidyāmantrapada) by which the evil ones as numerous as the grains of sand in the river Gaṅga are subjugated (nigraha) and established in awakening.”The bodhisatva Gaganagañja thereupon pronounced the words of knowledge-mantra as follows:tadyathā | avatte | vivatte | saṃvatte | sahitānusandhi | duruttaraṇi | nirghātani | maitryāyukte | kāruṇaniṣyande | satyavati | bhūrakṣe | dharmanivṛtti | dharmarakṣe | akkhule | nikhilini | hulu hulu hulu hulu hulu | tatkāre | tathāvādite | śīlānuvṛtti | akṣayanirdeśe | kleśaparīkṣe | buddhādhiṣṭhite dharmajvālini | saṃghānugame | anuttare | anatikramaṇiye | nigrahaṇimārapakṣasya yuktikṛte | adānte | aśaste | svaviṣayānugame | āryaguṇakāre | siddhisiddhivate | mokṣānukūle | nigrahaṇi parapravadīnāṃ | dārṣaṇi māraparṣada | avaśāntā | catvāro mahārājānaḥ | śakro devānāṃ indro brahmā sahapatir | buddhaprasannānāṃ | devanāgayakṣakṛtaṃ paritrāṇaṃ | satvānāṃ svastyayānāṃ | dharmabhanakānāṃ | ārakṣayai | saddharmasya ca parigrahāya |Then, immediately after these words of knowledge-mantra were pronounced by the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, the world system of three thousandfold worlds (trisāhasramahāsāhasralokadhātu) was shaken in six ways.The five hundred evil ones, who were without faith and clinging to the non-dharma, heard this sound from open space: “The Māra, his sons, or his followers (mārakāyika), who do not produce the thought of awakening and do not give up the works of the Māra after having heard these words of the knowledge-mantra (vidyāmantrapada), the crowns of their heads will be destroyed by the lighting and blazing thunderbolt of the Yakṣa Vajrapāṇi.”Then, having looked up at the sky, the sons of the Māra saw five hundred Vajrapāṇis holding blazing thunderbolt, and produced the thought of awakening from the fear and terror (bhayabhīṭa).The Lord at that time smiled (atha khalu bhagavān smitaṃ prādurakarot), and the venerable Ānanda asked its meaning.Then the Lord said: “Ānanda, did you see those five hundred sons of the Māra producing the thought of the incomparable complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi) out of fear and terror?”Ānanda said: “O Lord, I saw it.”The Lord said: “Ānanda, when the wicked Māra attains awakening, they will also be born in the buddha-fields as bodhisatvas having different name.”The venerable Ānanda said this to the Lord: “O Lord, when will the wicked Māra wake up to incomparable complete awakening? What will he be called after having attained the awakening? And what will be the name of that universe?”The Lord said: “Ānanda, the wicked Māra, doing the works of the Māra in the buddha-fields of ten directions again and again, will hear the dharma of destroying vices by the essence of diamond (vajragarbhakleśapramathanadharma) from the awakened buddhas there, and will see the secret practice, behaviour, good qualities, maintaining morality, practice, ceremony and application of the buddhas and the bodhisatvas. Then, as long as he has faith in the thought of awakening, he will be born [in the universe of] the tathāgata Anantāmaladhvaja, will stop doing the works of the Māra by the teaching of [the tathāgata there], will maturate this roots of good, and, by the thought which is no thought, in accordance with all the light of the dharma of the buddha (sarvabuddhadharmāvabhāsānugata), will produce the thought of awakening.After that, he will serve, respect, worship, homage and give offerings to the uncountable and innumerable tathāgatas, and will become a monk following their teachings.Having become a monk, he will uphold the true dharma (saddharma) in the three times, and bringing innumerable beings to maturity.After immeasurable forty-four intermediate aeons (antarakalpa), he will wake up to incomparable complete awakening, and then in the aeon called Viśuddhi he will be born in the Pariśuddhipratiṣṭhita universe as the tathāgata Supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdha, worthy of offerings, the perfectly awakened one, perfect in wisdom and conduct … a blessed one (supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdho nāma tathāgato ’rhan samyakṣaṃbuddho vidyācaraṇasaṃpannaḥ … bhagavān).Again, Ānanda, the Pariśuddhipratiṣṭhita universe will be thriving, prosperous, safe, well-provided, and filled with gods and men (ṛddhaś ca sphītaś ca kṣemaś ca subhikṣaś cākīrṇadevamānuṣaś ca).Ānanda, just as whatever enjoyments (bhoga) or entertainments (samudācāra) living beings in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha) have, so there will be enjoyments and entertainments [in that universe.]Ānanda, the tathāgata Supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdha will live to forty internal aeons (antarakalpa) together with the great assembly of sixty-four koṭis of disciples and the congregation of twelve thousands of bodhisatvas.O Ānanda, those who are the Māra’s sons and followers (mārakāyika) at present will be born in the Pariśuddhipratiṣṭhita universe, will reach the complete unsurpassable awakening, and will be predicted to attain of incomparable complete awakening by the tathāgata Supratiṣṭhitadharmālokalabdha, namely the Māra, in his buddha-field.”
Śakrabrahmalokapāla
When that prophecy (vyākaraṇa) of the wicked Māra was set forth, all the assembly of Indras, Brahmās and Lokapālas were astonished (āścaryaprāpta), and uttered a joyous utterance (udānam udānayati): “Even though they have done that many works of the Māra, they still can produce the thought of incomparable complete awakening by means of meaningfulness of seeing the tathāgata (tathāgatāmoghadarśana). The discipline of the dharma (dharmavinaya), which is well spoken (svākhyāta) by the Lord, is marvelous!O Lord, who is the son or daughter of good family (kulaputrā vā kuladuhitaro vā) who could measure (pramātṛ-) the buddha-fields (buddhakṣetra) from one person to another (pudgalena pudgalaḥ) because it cannot be measured by any disciple or isolated buddha?”The Lord said: “So it is, friends. The sphere of the buddha is just like what you said.However, friends, their thoughts are dependently originated, and I see living beings who walks with desire and who stops without desire, who wears a dharma-robe being full of impurities (saṃkleśa) and who puts on the robe without impurities (kleśa), and who eats porridge out of greed and who stops it without appetite. O friends, the types of behavior of living beings are so diverse.Since there are living beings who strive for [the buddha’s] words by understanding a condensed statement (udghaṭitajñā) or by understanding a full, detailed explanations (vipañcitajña), the tathāgata gives them the discourses of teaching the dharma, accordingly to each individual (yathāpratyarhadharmāvatāraṇanirdeśa).O friends, vices are neither established in place nor direction, and they are neither a collection nor accumulated things.Vices arise superficially (ayoniśas) but purity arises in the fundamental way (yoniśas). In that way, if you investigate the arising of vices fundamentally, then they arise as purity.It is therefore, with this in mind, said that, when one knows wrong views (mithyādṛṣṭi) as wrong views, namely as they really are (yathābhūta), he will have right views (samyagdṛṣṭi).Wrong views would never be right views, would never not be right views, would never be separated from right views. However, if one, after having known wrong views as wrong views, is not established in them without any action or effort, then he will enter into the way of right views, thus this is called the right view (samyagdṛṣṭi).O friends, vices are the darkness but the purity is the light. Vices are of weak power but the expanded vision is powerful. Vices are accidental but its essential nature is of pure root. Vices are false imaginations but its essential nature is the absence of false imagination (kavir4 mārṣā kleśāḥ | āloko viśuddhiḥ | durbalāḥ kleśāḥ | balavatī vipaśyanā | āgantukāḥ kleśāḥ | mūlaviśuddhā prakṛtiḥ | parikalpāḥ kleśāḥ | aparikalpā prakṛtiḥ).

Thus, among these four elements, namely earth, water, wind, and space, space is more powerful and firmer than any of the other elements, and is not accumulated. Since it is not accumulated, it is neither originated nor destroyed and is stable with its own essence (tad yathā mārṣā iyaṃ mahāpṛthivy apsu pratiṣṭhitā | āpo vāyau pratiṣṭhitāḥ | vāyur ākāśe pratiṣṭhitaḥ | apratiṣṭhitaṃ cākāśam | evam eṣāṃ caturṇāṃ dhātūnāṃ pṛthivīdhātor abdhātor vāyudhātor ākāśadhātur eva balī yo dṛḍho ’nupacayo ’napacayo ’nutpanno ’niruddhaḥ sthitaḥ svarasayogena |).

It is perceived that these are changeable, but space is by no means changeable (tatra ya ete trayo dhātavas ta utpādabhaṅgayuktā anavasthitā acirasthāpinaḥ | dṛśyata eṣāṃ vikāro na punar ākāśadhātoḥ kaścid vikāraḥ |).

The actions and vices have their basis in the superficial mental effort. The superficial mental effort has its basis in the purity of original nature. Therefore, it is said that the thought is basically pure but it is sullied by the occasional vices (evam eva skandhadhātvāyatanāni karmakleśapratiṣṭhitāni | karmakleśā ayoniśomanaskārapratiṣṭhitāḥ | ayoniśomanaskāraḥ prakṛtipariśuddhipratiṣṭhitaḥ | tata ucyate prakṛtiprabhāsvaraṃ cittam āgantukair upakleśair upakliśyata iti |).

When causes and conditions are not combined, they are extinguished. But their original nature is of no cause nor condition. Consequently, they are never combined. Thus there is no origination nor destruction of it.

Upāsaka Śrīgupta
gaganagañjaparipṛcchā, volume 8Then a lay practitioner by name of Śrīgupta, having bowed down at the Lord’s feet, addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, you set forth this exposition of religion which is the gate into the liberation from the dharma (dharmavimuktimukhadharmaparyāya) for me. Why is that? Lord, I tried to kill you by dropping you into a hole or by serving poisoned food, and even though I heard many teachings from you, I was not able to clear my doubts. However, Lord, having heard this exposition of religion, I do not have any doubt and obtain the light of all dharmas (sarvadharmāloka).O Lord, by obtaining the light without any regret or doubt, I will produce the thought of incomparable complete awakening and attain distinction just like the wicked Māra.”The Lord said: “Good, very good, householder, you fully understand the meaning of what I have preached (bhāṣitasyārtha). I prophesy that you, having honoured, revered, venerated, and worshipped all the buddhas in the good aeon (bhadrakalpa) with your mind and highest intension (cittādhyāśaya), will practice the holy life (brahmacaryā) in their places, and will grasp the true dharma (saddharma).After that, since you have pleased innumerable buddhas, after seven hundred innumerable aeons (asaṃkhyeyakalpa), in the stainless aeon (amalakalpa), you will be born in the world as the tathāgata Sarvaparyutthānavikiraṇa, equipped with knowledge, conduct and other qualities, the Awakened Lord (vidyācaraṇasaṃpanno iti yāvad buddho bhagavān bhaviṣyasi).Having heard the prophecy of the Lord concerning the incomparable complete awakening, a lay practitioner Śrīgupta, being contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant (tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajātaḥ), offered all his ornaments for the body of the Lord, and said:“O Lord, in my house I have four great treasuries, which are full of gold and plenty of jewels.Among them, one will be given to my wife and children, male and female slaves and workers (putradāradāsīdāsakarmakara).Another will be given to all the poor and beggars (sarvadaridrayācanaka).A third will be given to monks coming from four directions and the monastic communities in four directions.The other will be given to the monastic community headed by the Buddha (buddhapramukhabhikṣusaṅgha).O Lord, as I do not have any worldly attachment (amama) nor property (aparigraha), I pray that I may leave the world for the well-explained discipline, be ordained, and obtain the way as a monk (labheyāhaṃ svākhyāte dharmavinaye pravrajyām upasampadaṃ bhikṣubhāvam).”Then Śrīgupta thereupon left the world for the well-explained discipline, was ordained, and obtained the way as a monk.The bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “After the tathāgata become extinguished, O Lord, who will uphold this awakening which has been established for incalculable koṭis of aeons?”At that time, sixty koṭis of bodhisatvas, having stood up from the congregation, joined their palms, paid homage to the Lord, and then uttered these verses in one voice:
193 When the highest among humans was extinguished, O Lord, we will even sacrifice our bodies and lives to uphold the true dharma..(vayam utsahāmo bhagavan nirvṛte dvipadottame |saddharma dhārayiṣyāmaḥ tyaktvā kāyaṃ svajīvitam ||)  Quotations from ŚikṣMS 28a3-29a1; ŚikṣTib(D) 31a6-32a5; ŚikṣChi(T.1636) 84b12-c12, which are paralled with Ggn(D) 322b2-5; 323a3-5; 323a7-b3; 323b4-323a2.

This is not mere words.232 O King of the dharma (dharmarāja), the Light-maker (prabhākara), when this true dharma will be grasped, how much accumulation of merits (puṇyasaṃbhāra) will be there?
At that time, the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja:“Even if, son of good family, every thirty thousand world-system in the east is broken into the atomic-sized raindrops or the atomic-sized particles, and in the same way every thirty thousand world-system in the south, west, north, above, below and ten directions is also broken into the atomic-sized particles, and even if the buddha-fields in east, as numerous as all the particles, are put into one single atomic-sized particle, and in the same way, even if one calculates every single particle in the east until it is exhausted, it would not be enough to equal with the number of the buddha-fields,and just like in the east, the buddha-fields in each of the ten directions are immeasurable.What do you think, son of good family (tat kiṃ manyase kulaputra), can you calculate the particles in the ten directions, each of them contains the buddha-fields of the ten directions in such a way? Can you understand its limit?”Gaganagañja replied: “O Lord, nobody can do that. But the tathāgata is an exception, who knows it by means of the unattached knowledge of the buddha (buddhāsaṅgajñāna).”The Lord said: “If, son of good family, in all such buddha-fields there is a place in which the particles are posited, if all the buddha-fields become a town after having been encircled by a wall, and if the town, from its subterranean mass of water up to its highest point, is filled with only mustard seeds without roughness, then, what do you think, son of good family, how many mustard seeds would be there?”Gaganagañja said: “O Lord, it is marvelous that such analogy was sought out by the tathāgata. Having heard this analogy, O Lord, those living beings with faith will come to be endowed with a most marvelous thing (āścaryādbhutadharma).”The Lord said: “Son of good family, how many hundreds of, how many thousands of, how many hundred thousands of, how many vivāhas of, or how many akṣobhyas of mustard seeds there are, or how many buddha-fields there are, how many hundreds of buddha-fields there are, how many thousands of buddha-fields there are, or how many hundred thousands of buddha-fields there are, all of them the tathāgata knows.Even though, son of good family, one who want to reach awakening fills so many buddha-fields with seven kinds of precious jewels (saptaratna) giving them as a gift for the sake of awakening, if anybody grasps the true dharma and is established in such dharma of good qualities, then he who grasps the true dharma of one tathāgata will generate a lot more merit.Even though one honours, reveres, worships, adores and respects the buddhas as numerous as mustards seeds, if anybody accepts the profound dharma (gambhīradharma), then he will generate a lot more merit.Even though one makes endless offerings as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody makes the seven steps (saptapada), taking pleasure in and enduring the dharma without any hostility towards all beings (sarvasatvāpratihatacitta), he will generate a lot more merit.Even though one [accomplishes the works of] Indras, Brahmās, universal kings and bodhisatvas (śakrabrahmacakravartirājabodhisatva) as numerous as mustard seeds, if anybody, who knows that all conditioned things are impermanent and suffering (sarvaṃ saṃskṛtam anityaduḥkham), who understands that extinction is calm (śāntaṃ nirvāṇam), engenders the great compassion for all beings (satveṣu mahākaruṇotpadyate) and produces the thought of incomparable complete awakening for the sake of keeping the succession of the three jewels unbroken (triratnavaṃśasyānupacchedanārthaṃ), then he will generate a lot more merit.

Then the bodhisatva Gaganagañja addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, please give the tathāgata’s blessing over this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that, in the latter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasamaye), it will be disseminated and practiced throughout the Jambūdvīpa.”The Lord said: “For that reason, son of good family, I will invoke the Four Great Kings (cāturmahārāja) so that they will come and strive to keep this exposition of religion for a long time (dharmaparyāyacirasthti) with detailed and analytical explanation (vistaravibhāganirdeśa).These are the words for invoking: tadyathā | dhudhure | dhidhire | dhvajavati | dhvajālaṃkāre | āvartani | śame śamavati | śāntimukhe | nigrahaparapakṣa | anuttara | uttaravigama | samapatha | pathaśuddhi | pathānugama | pathasandhi | prajñāmukhe | āryakule | bhūtarakṣa ame sacca mene sacca tama sacca tatama sacca | buddhapāda | dharmānusandhi | āryagaṇānugama | āryanirghātani | ruṣṭaprāsādani | īśvarapadalokacittikṛte | anurāgayantu | imān dharmasandhi | vibhajantu nirukte | nirdeśe pratirakṣantu | dharmadhāraṇī |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the Four Great Kings.”Then the Four Great Kings, having become scared and fearful (bhayabhīṭa), approached the Lord, prostrated themselves at the Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, we, the Four Great Kings will protect, shield, guard (rakṣāvaraṇagupti) this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long and be beneficial.Wherever this exposition of religion is practiced, if there are devas, nāgas, yakśas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas or kiṃnaras (devanāgayakṣagandharvāsuragaruḍakinnara) who want the destruction of the dharma, we will subjugate them.Whosoever seek for the dharma, we will make them happy.We will offer hospitality to the congregation of the dharma-reciter (dharmabhāṇakaparṣanmaṇḍala), never forget the meaning of the words to be connected to the words (padānusaṃdhyasaṃpramoṣatā), give inspiration (pratibhāna), and increase recollection, intelligence, understanding and happiness (smṛtimatiprativedhamuditā).At these words, the Lord said this to the Four Great Kings: “Excellent, excellent, friends, you are my sons born of the dharma, and all of you demonstrate the effort to uphold my true dharma (saddharmaparigraha). With the outcome of the dharma (dharmaniṣyanda) all of you will be the masters of the world in this world, and after having transcended all the world, you will attain the final extinction (nirvāṇa) in the realm of noble extinction (āryanirvāṇadhātu).”
Śakra Devānām Indra
Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Son of good family, I will invoke Śakra, the lord of the gods (śakro devānām indraḥ), and by pronouncing the knowledge-mantra (vidyāmantra) he will remain for protecting this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) so that it may last long. The mantra is as follows:tadyathā | śubhe | śubhamati | śubhavyūhe | dudare |1 daride |2 duraṇi | dame śame | upaśame | khube | ugaśame | khabe | ugakhare | asomukhe | dhāraṇi | araddi | suśruṣe | sahite | abhede bhedadandhi saume samavati samarasmi | aśe | huhu | hehe | khurukhure | anatikrame | devarakṣasahe he mahābhāvabhāsabrame | āgacchatu śakro devānāṃ | mantradaśaśatanayena3 | brahmakuṭadhāra | īśvara umarut babhana nivasi |Son of good family, these are the words for invoking the lord of gods by which he will be invoked and remain for this exposition of religion to last long.”Because of the impact of the dharma (dharmapravega), the lord of the gods became full of happiness and all his dwelling places in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven were shaken. Then, together with many hundreds of thousands of attendant gods, he approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and said this to the Lord:“O Lord, I am Śakra, the lord of gods, who have the mastery of the gods in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Together with a multitude of attendant gods, I will strive to disseminate this exposition of religion throughout the Jambūdvīpa.I will never do violence to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) who retain this sūtra, delight in them, have faith in them, and adorn them by adornments of the dharma. Wherever they teach this exposition of religion in a village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), I will protect, shield and guard them.O Lord, I will go to the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka) in order to listen the dharma (dharmaśravaṇa).[Even if someone] insults or abuses [the preachers of the dharma,] I will make him accept them.4I will protect, shield and guard them from the harmful obstruction of Māra.”The Lord said: “Excellent, excellent, Kauśika, since you have obtained the power of gods, you, having entered into the power of the dharma, will roar the lion’s road (siṃhanādanādi) in order to uphold all the buddha’s true dharma (saddharma).Why is that? Kauśika, if you uphold the true dharma of one tathāgata, then you are also upholding the true dharma of the Awakened Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).”
Brahmā Sahāṃpati
Then the Lord said to the bodhisatva Gaganagañja: “Then, son of good family, I will invoke the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā (brahmā sahāṃpati), and because of that he will continue protecting this exposition of religion. The words of invoking is as follows:tadyathā | maitre | śubhamaitre | dharmamaitre | maitryānusahite samaitre | sandhimaitre | anugamamaitre | anugacchamaitre | anuttāramaitre | sātramaitre | dharmamaitre | anugrahamaitre | apratisārimaitre | ullalokanamaitre5 | vilokanamaitre | vilokanamaitre | bebhyaḥ anugamanamaitre | buddhādhiṣṭḥānamaitre | anurāgākṣamaitre | anurāgākṣamaitre | dharmapratisāraṇamaitre | mokṣamaitre | o no o no nur oṃ dhe | virodhamaitre | o to mo maitre | brahmapathamaitre | dhyānālaṃkaramaitre | tasyānusandhikāruṇamaitre | tasyānusandhimutiṭāmaitre | tasya sānusanddhi | upekṣāmaitre | brahmapathānugamanamaitre | ciita utstsi la lyamaitre | anusāraṇamaitre | nistiraṅamaitre | sarvatānugamanamaitre | āgacchatu brahma | udprijya | dānasukena | vyūtiṣṭhāsvamadhye| nitramamahāvimanāda | viavalokāya | jambudvipanakuruśādharmarakṣāna | mātikramabuddhādhiṣṭhānāṃ |Those treasuries of open space are the words of invoking the Brahā, the lord of Sahā.”Then the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, dwelling in the heaven of Brahmā (brahmaloka), became aware of the presence of the buddha (buddhādhiṣṭhāna), heard these words of friendly mantra (maitrīmantra) by the power of the Buddha (buddhānubhāva), namely the sphere of divine hearing (divyaśrotradhātu), together with sixty-eight hundred thousand Brahmās, approached to the Lord, prostrated himself at the Lord’s feet, and sat down on a side.Having sat down on a side, the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā, addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, since we are sustained by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhānādhiṣṭhita), we will be endowed with friendliness and compassion (maitrīkaruṇā) and strive for this exposition of religion.As for the dharma-reciters (dharmabhāṇaka), who, having collected this teaching of the buddha, understand it, retain it, read it, teach it, and make it into a book (pustaka), wherever they hold religious discourses (dharmakathā) in the wilderness (araṇya), forest (utpathamārga), village (sagrāma), city (nagara), town (nigama), kingdom (rāṣṭra) or capital (rājadhāni), if they explain this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) in detail, then we will protect them, shield them, guard them, rejoice them, fulfill energy (bala), attain recollection (smṛti), acquire intelligence (mati), be accordance with realization (prativedha), fulfill eloquence (pratibhāna), inspire the unbelieving with faith, and liberate those who have faith. According to the tathāgata’s guiding principle of the dharma (tathāgatadharmanaya), Lord, we will uphold and disseminate it”At these words, the Lord said this to the Brahmā, the lord of Sahā: “Excellent, excellent, Brahmā, since you uphold the true dharma, the tathāgata rejoices in you.Just as I am turning the wheel of the dharma (dharmacakra), just so, Brahmā, you also will before long turn it.Just as you are upholding my true dharma, just so other Brahmās will uphold your true dharma.”
Bodhisatva Maitreya
Then the Lord said this to the bodhisatva, the great being Maitreya: “O Maitreya, I entrust (parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening, which has been established for countless hundreds of millions of aeons, in order that it will be memorized, understood, read, and elucidated in detail to others, in order to give thanks and gratitude to the tathāgata, fulfill my aspirations (abhiprāya), increase and purify many beings’ roots of good (kuśalamūla), make the bodhisatvas attain the light of the dharma (dharmāloka), subjugate all Māras, defeat all heretics (tīrthika), uphold the dharma of the highest meaning (paramārthadharma), and in order not to break the continuity of the three jewels (triratnavaṃśānupaccheda).”At these words, the bodhisatva Maitreya addressed himself to the Lord: “O Lord, I will protect this unexcelled treasury of the Dharma Jewel (anuttaradharmaratnanidhāna) for the sake of the complete extinction of the tathāgata (tathāgataparinirvāṇa).Why is that? Because, Lord, this is the true dharma (saddharma) of myself and the Awakened Lords in the past, present and future (atītānāgatapratyutpanna).O Lord, when I have dwelled in the Tuṣita Heaven (tuṣitabhavanastha), I have strived for protecting, upholding, and keeping these sūtras for a long time.O Lord, in the latter time, in the latter age (paścimakāle paścimasameye), if someone were to hear this true sūtra, grasp it, retain it, recite it, fully explain it to others, and practice it himself, may you know that it is because of the sustaining power of maitreya (maitreyādhiṣṭhāna).If, Lord, the partisans of the Māra were to attack, even further, if the root of goods were to fill up every pore of my whole body, and then if all living beings in the world system of three thousand worlds were to become the wicked Māras, they do not approach even a hundredth part of the root of goods in one of the pores and so on, until nor do they approach even the likeness of it (ekaromakūpasya kuśalamūlaḥ śatatamīm api kalāṃ nopaiti yāvad upamām api nopaiti).O Lord, as all regions of Māras (sarvamāramaṇḍala) were conquered by the power of my merits (puṇyabala) and the power of my knowledge (jñānabala), this awakening will be protected by the tathāgata for countless millions.”The Lord said: “Good, good, Maitreya, these four are the bodhisatva’s actions. What four? 1) conquering all Māras and vices (sarvamārakleśanigraha); 2) defeating all opponents (sarvaparapravādin) in accordance with the dharma (dharmānulomikābhibhava); 3) bringing all beings to maturity (satvaparipācana); 4) upholding the true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).Those four actions are belonging to one, namely, upholding the true dharma (saddharmaparigraha).”
Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda
Then the Lord said this to the elder Mahākāśyapa and the venerable Ānanda: “Mahākāśyapa and Ānanda, I entrust (parindāmi) you with this [teaching of] incomparable complete awakening so that it will be memorized, understood, read and elucidated to others.”The Mahākāśyapa said: “O Lord, we will uphold this awakening of the tathāgata with all my might.”The Ānanda said: “O Lord, we will take up this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya) and disseminate it by the presence of the tathāgata (tathāgatādhiṣṭhāna).”
Bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra
Then the bodhisatva, the great being Puṇyālaṃkāra addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, what the Lord had said (tathāgatabhāṣita) in this sūtra is deep and profound in illumination, free from mental activity (pracāra), difficult to see its explicit meaning (nītārthadurdṛśya), difficult to understand (duradhigamya), endowed with the higher truth (paramārtha), namely emptiness (śūnyatā), adorned with the adornment of morality (śīlālaṃkārālaṃkṛta), producing recollection (smṛti), concentration (samādhi), penetration (nirvedhika) and happiness in thought (manaspraharṣaṇa), illuminating the light of insight (prajñāraśmi), revealing liberation (vimukti), peaceful, unsullied, known by the wise and accomplished ones, praised and extolled by all buddhas (sarvabuddhasaṃstutapraśasta), sealed with the seal of the king of memory and sūtras (dhāraṇīsūtrāntarājamudrāmudrita), grasping the unhindered eloquence (apratihatapratibhānagrahaṇa), increasing recollection, intelligence, understanding and confidence (smṛtimatiprativedhādhimuktivivardhana), not surpassed by any Māra or adversary (sarvamārapratyarthikānabhibhūta), rebuking immoral beings (duḥśīla), established in the dharma which is the qualities of purity, austerity, fulfilling vows and the qualities of giving (dhūtaguṇasaṃlekhasaṃvaraniryātatyāgaguṇadharmapratiṣṭhita), and originated from endless good merits (anantaguṇadharmanirjāta). If sons of good family or daughters of good family were to bear this teaching and knowledge of all the buddhas in their minds, grasp it, retain it, read it, master it, elucidate it to others, write it, copy it, recite it, think about it, examine it, reflect on it, and be established in the progress (pratipattipratiṣṭhita), then how much merit (puṇya) they will generate?”Then the Lord spoke the following verses to the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra:
233 Even though the bodhisatva sees immeasurably extensive fields in ten directions by the eye of the buddha (buddhalocanā), fills all those places with jewels, and gives them as a gift, if there is someone who retains, reads and teaches such excellent and unsullied sūtra which has been taught by many buddhas, then his merit would be better.234 Even though the bodhisatva fills all those fields with flowers (puṣpa), fragrances (sugandha), ointments (vilepana), parasols (chattra), flags (patākā), banners (dhvaja) and wreath s of cloth, and makes an offering to the buddhas, if there is someone taking care of the true dharma (saddharma) to be grasped at the time of the disintegration and cessation of the dharma of the Well-gone One (sugata), then his merit would be better.235 Even though the bodhisatva places a lamp (pradīpa) on shrines (caitya) dedicated to the Victorious One (jina), which is filled with perfumed oil like the ocean (sāgara) in ten directions and made of a wick (varti) like the Mt. Sumeru, if there is someone who, having known that the whole world is covered by darkness (andhakāra), upholds this dharma taught by the Victorious One when the lamp of the dharma (dharmapradīpa) is extinguished, then his merit would be better.236 Even though the bodhisatva, seeking the highest awakening (agrabodhi) of the buddha, seeing the leaders (nāyaka) in ten millions of fields, has offered beautiful [clothes] made of silk for many millions of aeons, if there is someone who, giving thanks to the buddha, upholding (anugraha) the three jewels (triratna), grasps the true dharma (saddharma) to be apprehended by living beings, then his merit would be better.237 In the same way that I grasp the dharma of the protectors (nātha), I see living beings by the eye of the buddha (buddhalocanā) and teach them to be Śakras or Brahmās, but it does not increase merit that much. Even though I teach all those beings to be the worthy ones (arhat) or to mount on the vehicle of the isolated buddha (pratyekayāna), if there is someone who, having generated the thought of awakening (bodhicitta), upholds the true dharma (saddharma), then it would be better (viśiṣṭa).238 If his merit has a material form, all the fields in ten direction would be filled up with it, and there would be no vessel [to contain that merit] except for the the knowledge of the best of men (puruṣarṣabhajñāna). Just as, even if one expresses the knowledge of the buddha (buddhajñāna) for ten thousand aeons, there will be no end, just so it is impossible to measure the merit of upholding the true dharma of the tathāgata.
Then the bodhisatva Puṇyālaṃkāra, having heard this teaching on the merit of upholding the true dharma from the Lord, became contented, elated, enraptured, overjoyed, exultant and jubilant (tuṣṭodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditaḥ prītisaumanasyajāto bhavati), and addressed himself to the Lord:“O Lord, the bodhisatvas, who do not strive for upholding the true dharma, will be beset by the Māra (mārādhiṣṭhita).If, O Lord, there are bodhisatvas who [have planted] all other roots of good without upholding the true dharma, their merits would be merely as a mustard seed (sarṣapa).The roots of good stemming from upholding the true dharma are established in the conception of a self (ātmasaṃjñā), which is exactly the same as the sphere of space (gaganadhātu) in ten directions.In order to seek for the happiness of all living beings (sarvasatvasukha), O Lord, I will give up my body and soul (kāyajīvita), and, without desiring any happiness for me, will put on the armour for the sake of upholding the true dharma.”When this exposition of religion was set forth, due to the maturation of the bodhisatva Gaganagañja’s merit, in order to pay homage (pūjākarmaṇa) to this exposition of religion (dharmaparyāya), the bodhisatvas, who have the same thoughts with the bodhisatva Gaganagañja, dwelling in immeasurable buddha-fields in ten directions, poured down the rain of flowers (puṣpavarṣa) from the vault of the sky.Then this sound resonated in open space: “While adorning and upholding this chapter of the Great Collection (mahāsaṃnipātaparivarta), the bodhisatva, the great being Gaganagañja has done the buddha-activities (buddhakārya).The living beings who are not separated from the thought of awakening (bodhicittāviyukta) will uphold this exposition of religion, and in the same way, they will adorn the true dharma.”Then at that time, the Lord emitted such light from his body, thereby all buddha-fileds in ten directions became filled with it.When the beginning, middle and end of this exposition of religion was set forth, immeasurable, incalculable living beings produced the thought of awakening, and attained the tolerance [that all things are unborn (anutpattikadharmakṣānti).]Some of their thoughts were liberated, some of them attained the eyes of the dharma (dharmacakṣuḥ), some of them became free from desire, some of them acquired the good qualities of gods and men (devamanuṣyasaṃpatti) and gathered causes for seeing other buddhas, and even the Lord was pleased with all of them.As the Lord had uttered these words, the bodhisatva great being Gaganagañja, the bodhisatva great being Maitreya, the bodhisatva great being Kutūhalajāta, the bodhisatva great being Ratnapāṇi, the bodhisatva great being Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva great being Guṇarājaprabhāsa, the bodhisatva great being Puṇyālaṃkāra, the bodhisatva great being Apāyajaha, the bodhisatva great being Dharmarāja, the venerable Śāriputra, the venerable Mahākāśyapa, the venerable Ānanda, the Brahmā king of Sahā, Śakra king of the gods, the Four Great Kings, the monks, the bodhisatvas, the whole of that assembly, and the world with its gods, human beings, anti-gods and gandharvas praised what the Lord had preached (idam avocad bhagavān āttamanā gaganagañjo bodhisatvo mahāsatvaḥ ca maitreyo bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca kutūhalajāto bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca ratnapāṇir bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca mañjuśrīr bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca guṇarājaprabhāso bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca puṇyālaṃkāro bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca apāyajaho bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca dharmarājo bodhisatvo mahāsatvaś ca śāriputraḥ āyuṣmāṃś ca mahākāśyapaḥ āyuṣmāṃś ca ānandaḥ āyuṣmāṃś ca brahmā sahāṃpatiś ca śakraś ca devānām indraś catvāraś ca mahārājānaḥ te ca bhikṣavaḥ te ca mahāśrāvakāś sā ca sarvāvatī parṣat sadevamānuṣāsuragandharvaś ca loko bhagavato bhāṣitam abhyanandann iti).
